A year ago, a white police officer killed a black teenager.

The teen's name was Michael Brown. He was 18 years old and lived in Ferguson, Missouri. He was killed on August 9, 2014.

The same day, people in Ferguson began protesting. They were tired of being poor. They also were tired of being treated unfairly.

Brown's death was only the first chapter of the story. It is not over yet.

Country Talking About How Black People Are Treated

Now a year later, hundreds of lives have changed. People are talking about how police treat black people. The shooting also made young people very angry. They are fighting for equal rights for blacks across the country.

Today, Ferguson is not the same town as it was.

A government report found that Ferguson police did treat black people unfairly. Police stopped cars just because they had black drivers. Police also gave black people tickets and put them in jail to make money. The report has led to changes in Missouri.

Police Departments Making Changes

Investigators found that Officer Darren Wilson shot Brown during a struggle. Wilson was not charged with a crime. Still, police departments across the country do not want to become like Ferguson. They are making changes.

The country saw what happened in Ferguson. The way many people think has changed. Many more white people now agree that black people are treated unfairly.

In Ferguson, the city has tried to go back to normal.

A year ago, protesters burned down businesses. The ashes have been swept away. The streets are clear. Customers have started to shop in stores again, said Antonio Henley. He is a barber. During the protests, he lost about half of his customers.

Change has also come to the city government.

Mayor Is Still In Office But Other People Quit

Several city officials have quit. The government report said they sent anti-black emails. Ferguson still has the same mayor, who is white. He does not want to leave.

Ferguson's City Council had only 1 black member out of 6 before Brown’s shooting. Now it has 3.

Thomas Harvey is the head of ArchCity Defenders. The group works to make the court system more fair. He said Ferguson’s new judge is treating people with respect.

Ferguson is just one small town, Harvey said. There are many other small towns nearby. Many of them have the same problems as Ferguson. People will say nothing has changed.
