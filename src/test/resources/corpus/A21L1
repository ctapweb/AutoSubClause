In 2006, Michael Cox was a chicken farmer in Arkansas. He knew he had to find a way to make his business expand or it would fail. His family had been raising chickens for many years. Even with 800,000 hens, Cox's farm was just not big enough. He said he felt like the business was dying.

Cox, who was 25 years old, started producing more expensive "organic" eggs. They are eggs from chickens that eat healthy food and are not given drugs. They are also allowed to go outside.

A few years later, he heard about a new company called Vital Farms. They wanted to sell "pasture-raised eggs." Those are eggs that come from hens that get to spend all day outside. They eat grass or whatever they find. Most chickens are fed only corn. "Here were guys doing something completely different," Cox remembers. "It was just crazy enough to work."

He agreed to raise 5,000 chickens for Vital Farms.

Outdoor Chickens Are Happier

Since then, Vital Farms has nearly doubled in size each year. It started with just a few thousand birds. Now it works with about 60 farms and produces more than 1 million eggs every week. The eggs cost between $5 and $9 for a dozen. They are sold across the country in grocery stores like Whole Foods and Safeway.

Jason Jones is the president of Vital Farms. He said he wanted to build a big business and do things the right way.

Matt O'Hayer is the one who started the company. "Our job is to show people that an egg is not just an egg," he said.

But shoppers are still confused about the different types of eggs. Most people do not know what "pasture-raised" means. Most think "cage-free" and "free-range" mean the birds have been raised outdoors.

In fact, cage-free hens live in a tiny indoor space and never go outside. Free-range hens get a little bit more space outdoors. A Vital Farms hen spends most of her day outside if the weather is nice. She is also given a lot more room outside.

They Cost More, But People Like Them

O'Hayer delivered eggs as a middle schooler and raised backyard chickens in the 1980s. That is when he realized that when a hen eats better, her eggs are better. For example, if she eats only corn, her yolks (the middle, yellow part) are pale and do not have much flavor. But if she eats grass, her yolks turn gold and taste better.

Raising hens the Vital Farms way makes the eggs cost more. That is why the company works hard to let people know how good they are. It seems to be working. Whole Foods says many shoppers buy pasture-raised eggs. Kroger plans to sell Vital Farms eggs in most of its stores by the end of the year.

Some people will also go out of their way to find Vital Farms eggs. Maurice Sinnett, who lives in Washington state, used to buy them at Safeway. When it closed, he went looking at Albertsons. But they did not carry them. So Sinnett started shopping at a third store. "It may seem crazy to change stores just for the eggs, but we think they are just that good," he said.

Sinnett likes the richer yolk. But mostly, he feels good about the company's respect for animals. That is one of the reasons why he is willing to pay $6 for a dozen eggs.
