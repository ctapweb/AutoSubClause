TEMPE, Arizona — Jen Welter cannot wait to get to work. Starting this weekend, she will coach linebackers for the Arizona Cardinals football team.

The job is only for six weeks. She will be there through training camp and the four preseason games. Still, she has broken through a wall for women in sports. Welter is the latest woman to enter what had been a men-only position.

Welter said she never dared imagine coaching in the National Football League.

"I didn't even dream that it was possible," Welter said at Cardinals headquarters. "Though it's a dream I never could have had, now it's a dream other girls can grow up and have."

"She's a trailblazer," Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said.

Team President Michael Bidwill said Welter has the full support of the Cardinals. Bidwill said he spoke Monday night with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. He congratulated the Cardinals on the decision.

Put Your Mind To It And Do It

Welter is known as Dr. Jen back in Texas. She has a doctorate degree in psychology. It is the study of the human mind and how it works. She also spent a season as a player on a men's team. That team is the Texas Revolution of the Indoor Football League.

Welter said there are many people who are better at coming up with game plans. She is good at understanding players, and she never quits. "Those are things I know I can add to."

Welter said that for too long girls have been given the wrong message. They are told it it is so important to be pretty.

"We teach them very early on to be pretty, marry well," Welter said. "That's what they grow up thinking what fame is or success is."

Welter said she wants little girls to grow up knowing something important. "When they put their minds to something, when they work hard, they can do anything."

Perfect For The Job

Coach Arians was at a NFL owners' meeting in March. He was asked about women coaches.

"The minute they can prove they can make a player better, they'll be hired," Arians said.

A short time later, the coach of the Texas Revolution men's team got in touch with Arians. He told Arians he knew someone who might be perfect for the job.

Arians called Welter. He offered her one of the team's six internships. An internship gives a person on-the-job training.

One Step, Then Another

Welter grew up in Florida. Her first love was football. When she was little, her family would drag a mattress outside. Then she would have the bigger kids tackle her.

Welter spent 14 years as a linebacker. Most of them were with the Dallas Diamonds of the Women's Football Alliance.

Welter's first paycheck came in 2004. It was for $12, or $1 for each game she played. She said she still carries the check. It proved she was a pro.

A year ago, she played on a men's professional football team. She was the first woman to play a non-kicking position. Last February, she became the first woman to coach for a men's pro team.

Arians said the job is the first step to working full-time for the NFL.

That is exactly what Welter wants.
