FORT BENNING, Ga. — On Friday, there was a ceremony at an Army base in Georgia. It was a very special day. A group of soldiers had finished Ranger School. The ceremony was their graduation from the program.

Rangers are some of the strongest soldiers in the Army. They are also some of the smartest. Ranger School is very hard. It was an important ceremony for another reason, too. For the first time ever, two women were graduating from Ranger School.

Right now, women can be in the military. They cannot have all the same jobs that men have. Some jobs are off limits to women. That might change soon. The government is now thinking about giving women permission to have these jobs. Women who go to Ranger School have the same training as men. However, some people do not like the idea of allowing women to fight in war.

Ranger School Is Long And Very Hard

The two women who finished Ranger School are Shaye Haver and Kristen Griest. Shaye is a first lieutenant. She is from Texas. Shaye flies helicopters. Kristen is from Connecticut and is a captain. These two women and 94 men finished the course.

Ranger School is 9 weeks long. It is very hard. It challenges men and women. Ranger School is like a long test for your brain and body.

Kristen is 26 years old. Shaye is 25. Nineteen women started Ranger School. These women are the first two who finished.

Not Everyone Wants Women In Combat

Ranger School is not easy for soldiers. Kristen had to work hard to graduate. She was successful. It was not always easy. She wants to help other women succeed. She believes in women. She said women can handle the same challenges men face. Even though it is hard, she said you have to believe in yourself, no matter who you are.

Not everyone agrees. Some people do not want women in combat jobs.

Army Ranger School is not easy. Those who make it all the way are the smartest and strongest. Many soldiers start the class. Most fail and do not graduate. It is the hardest in the beginning. There are many tests from the start.

In one test, soldiers have to march on foot for 12 miles. Even though it is very hard, Shaye and Kristen did it. Their success is a good reminder for women everywhere.
