Mauna Kea is a special mountain in Hawaii.

Its beautiful forests are loved by many people. Astronomers look at the stars from its top. Native Hawaiians believe it is home to their ancient gods. The mountain is about 1 million years old.

Now scientists and Hawaiians are battling over it.

Scientists want to build a huge telescope on its peak. Many Native Hawaiians do not like the project. Native Hawaiians are the ancient people of Hawaii's islands. Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean. Hawaiians want to protect their sacred mountain.

Looking Way Out Into Space

The telescope is called the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). It is named for its light-gathering mirror. The mirror is about 100 feet wide. The telescope will see as much as 100 times farther away than any other telescope. It will allow astronomers to gaze out to the farthest stars in the universe.

Protesters have tried to stop the telescope from being built. They recently blocked the road to the mountain top. They waved flags and sang songs. Some left large stones in the middle of the road. Other people camped there overnight.

The TMT would not be the first telescope on the mountain top. Right now there are 13 telescopes. But it would be the biggest telescope.

Mountain Is A Special Place

The mountain is important to Native Hawaiians. It began as a volcano. In their culture, they say the mountain is where the sky and earth separated. It is where the mother and father of Hawaiians first met. In the past, only high chiefs and priests climbed to the top.

Kealoha Pisciotta is a Native Hawaiian. She is trying to stop the telescope.

Pisciotta says she supports astronomy. Astronomy is the study of space. Still, Pisciotta said there are other things that are more important. Pisciotta thinks the telescope will ruin the mountain's beauty and power. She also says the telescope would put its forests at risk. A study says that this would not happen though.

Even some scientists are beginning to question the project.

Emily Rice is a scientist. She studied the stars using one of the other telescopes on the mountain. In April, she wrote on Twitter about the telescope. She thinks it should be built. Scientists need to understand that the mountain is important for Hawaiians, she said. The scientists need to set a good example.
