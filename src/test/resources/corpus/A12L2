WASHINGTON, D.C. — Some states want to get kids to go play outside. They are offering campouts and activities in state parks. The states want to get kids moving and teach them that parks are important.

Experts say kids are hooked on technology. Kids spend about 7 hours a day with electronic devices. They are watching TV and using computers and their phones. They are playing outside less and less. Kids are not getting exercise, and the number of obese, or overweight, kids has jumped recently.

Obesity in young kids has doubled in the last 30 years. Obesity in teens is 4 times what it was 30 years ago. More than one-third of kids were obese in 2012.

Children Should Learn To Enjoy, Protect Nature

State parks officials say they have to get young people outdoors. Kids need to enjoy the real world, said Lewis Ledford. He is chief of the National Association of State Park Directors. Being outdoors will also teach kids to protect nature, said Ledford.

There are more than 5,000 state parks in the United States. They include wildlife and historic sites.

The parks have been drawing more visitors in the last 4 years. However, parks are not getting enough money from their states to pay their costs. Many parks have cut jobs or cut hours and programs. Some have increased entrance and camping fees.

Our future leaders will not protect nature if they do not experience it, said Nita Settina. She is a manager of the Maryland Park Service.

Make It Fun And Kids Will Come

If parks offer fun adventures, kids will visit, said Settina. Someday, they will bring their own children, she added.

Parks in some states offer summer jobs for teens. They spend the summer working on the parks and enjoying the activities.

Maryland parks have offered teens jobs for 8 years. This summer, about 300 teens worked in the parks. They also spent part of their time canoeing, fishing and camping.

Most of the teens came from Baltimore or other city areas. Many of them were not familiar with outdoor life. Some of them had never left their neighborhoods. It was the first time many of them had seen the Atlantic Ocean or had been camping, Settina said.

“It’s one of the most important things we do. It’s also one of the most gratifying,” she said.

Campout Program Puts Families Under The Stars

Other states offer family campouts in their state parks. The program is called Capital Campouts.

The governor of Delaware invited 10 families to a state park. They set up tents and camped overnight. The campers learned about nature and roasted s’mores by the campfire.

In New Mexico, the Parks Department trains teachers in state parks. Teachers learn about water quality and how to spot insects and birds. They take their students to the parks for lessons.

The program is trying to preserve the history of New Mexico, said Christy Tafoya. She is the state parks director. She said the program teaches young people to appreciate the parks and protect them.

Urging Kids To Plug Into Nature, Not Video Games

A whole generation of kids grew up with video games, said Ray Bivens. He is director of Delaware State Parks. Those kids will not put down their devices and go outside, he said.

The parks need to have programs that teach kids outdoor skills, he said. "Being able to identify a couple of stars in the night sky, they just love it."
