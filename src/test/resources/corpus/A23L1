Misty Copeland made history on Tuesday.

She is the first black ballerina to be a lead dancer at American Ballet Theatre (ABT). The ballet company is one of the best in the world. It usually hires only thin white dancers.

Copeland is 32. She is one of America's most famous female athletes. She is respected - and not just for her dancing.

When "The Wrong Body" Is Right

Copeland wrote a popular children's book about her life. It is called "Firebird." She named it after one of her first big roles with the dance company.

Time magazine called her one of the 100 most important people in the world.

She also starred in a sportswear ad that was very popular on the Internet. It showed her twirling. In the background, a woman's voice reads a letter declaring she has "the wrong body for ballet."

Copeland has a different body type than most ballerinas. She has bigger muscles. She also weighs more.

The ad has been seen more than 8 million times on YouTube. Copeland has more than 500,000 followers on Instagram and Twitter.

"Bringing on Misty Copeland is the best decision we've ever made," said Adrienne Lofton. She is a top official at the sportswear company. It is called Under Armour.

Copeland shows "that athletes come in all shapes and sizes," Lofton said.

From Late Start To White Swan

This spring, Copeland starred in the ballet "Swan Lake." It was an important moment in American arts. Copeland became the first black woman to dance the ballet's white swan. All of her performances were sold out.

Copeland said she has a different background than most ballerinas. Most dancers are white and come from families with enough money. Copeland grew up in a single-parent home. They did not have much money. Her mother struggled to support the family.

At 13, Copeland took her first dance class. That is late for a young ballerina.

She said her mother taught her to succeed at whatever she did.

Copeland said she always tries to do her best. This is not just important for her fans. It is also important for her.
