Nefertiti was a beautiful queen who ruled in ancient Egypt. She lived almost 3,400 years ago.

Nefertiti has long been at the center of a mystery. For years, scientists have wondered where she was buried.

Search For A Lost Queen

Nefertiti belonged to the family line of the famous King Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut. Indeed, some believe she was Tut's mother.

Scientists know where all the others in the royal line are buried. Nefertiti is still missing, though.

Now, a scientist named Nicholas Reeves says he has found her. Reeves is an archaeologist. He studies ancient human societies.

Reeves says Nefertiti is buried in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. He thinks she is hidden just beyond a wall near the resting place of King Tut.

Are Those Secret Doors?

King Tut is buried in a set of underground rooms known as a tomb. Tut is called a pharaoh, like all of the kings of ancient Egypt.

Reeves came up with his surprising idea after studying the walls of Tut's tomb. He used a special kind of camera for his study. It allowed him to to see beneath paint that covers the tomb's walls.

Reeves found a number of cracks in the walls. He thinks these may be the edges of two doors hidden beneath the thick paint.

One of these doors may lead to a storeroom, Reeves said. However, the larger door could lead to another room holding the body of Nefertiti.

Testing A Theory

More tests will be needed to show whether or not Reeves is right.

"If I'm wrong, I'm wrong," Reeves said. However, if he is right, it could be "the biggest archaeological discovery ever made," he said.

King Tut's tomb was first discovered in 1922. It was found by archaeologist Howard Carter. Tut's tomb was filled with thousands of amazing and beautiful treasures.

Archaeologists would be thrilled to find Nefertiti's tomb.

Another Royal Treasure Room?

The queen was famed for her beauty. She served as co-ruler with King Akhenaten, her husband. She may also have been a pharaoh on her own after his death. Most likely her tomb would be filled with as many treasures as Tut's. Perhaps there would be even more.

Ancient Egyptians believed in life after death. The dead were carefully prepared for their afterlife. Riches and other belongings were buried with them so they could be used in the afterlife. Families were expected to bring food to the tombs.

Breaking into a pharaoh's tomb was considered a terrible thing to do. Even now, some believe there is a "Pharaoh's Curse." They say opening a tomb brings bad luck. Indeed, 12 of the people who discovered King Tut's tomb with Carter came to a bad end. They all died within seven years of opening the tomb.

Dreams Of A Past Life

There is also the strange story of Englishwoman Dorothy Louise Eady. She believed she had lived in ancient Egypt during a past life.

Eady grew up dreaming about ancient Egypt. She eventually moved to Egypt, where she worked with well-known archaeologists. Eady made a number of archaeological discoveries. She claimed her discoveries were based on things she remembered from her past life.

Eady also claimed she knew where the tomb of Nefertiti was hidden. She said a pharaoh had told her during her earlier life.

"It's in the Valley of the Kings, and it's quite near to the Tutankhamun tomb," she said. "But it's in a place where nobody would ever think of looking for it."

It may just turn out that Eady was right all along.
