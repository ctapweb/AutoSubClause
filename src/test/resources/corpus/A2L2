NEW YORK, N.Y. – Not long ago, I met a young girl in a refugee camp in Jordan. Like the tens of thousands of other children there, she and her family had left Syria. The country in the Middle East has faced a lot of violence. I first met her in a tent classroom near where she was sleeping. Later, I saw her again, playing with other children on a poorly built playground.

I asked her where she would rather be, learning in the classroom or playing with her friends. I know what my answer would have been at her age — the playground. Still, she chose the classroom and her answer says a lot. The violence in Syria forced her to leave behind her home and friends. Her education was the one thing she could not afford to lose. She needed an education if she was ever going to get her dream. She wants to grow up and become a doctor.

School Offers Safety And Hope

I have heard that same desire for learning from so many children affected by the crisis in Syria and other emergencies around the world. Children desperately want to go to school. Their families want them to get an education.

In the middle of violence and constant change, school is a safe place. It is a place to learn, get opportunities and live a healthy life. It is a place where children can hope for the future. Education increases the chances that someday children will be able to make money. Then they can give their families a better life. Education also provides them with the skills to help the communities they are from. Once the fighting is over, it can help them forgive those who wronged them during the wars.

Education Is An Important Goal

So reaching the children affected by emergencies and giving them the chance to learn definitely helps them. It also helps their home countries. Leaders around the globe have plans. They want to start focusing on some new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals will help make good changes in poor countries across the world. Development goals help leaders work with their countries so they can be more independent, make their own money and help the people in those countries. Focusing on education is extremely important as leaders discuss these goals.

The good news is that people around the world agree that schools are important. They can help to create a more equal and stable society. The Sustainable Development Goal for education shows this. It says that everyone should be able to get an education no matter what.

As we begin working toward the new goal, there is a problem. There are so many children facing danger around the world. According to a new report by the Overseas Development Institute, nearly 1 in 3 children out of school today is living in a country affected by crisis.

Lots Of Children In Crisis

For the youngest children, these crises mean they never start school. For others, it means they must stop going to school and might never go back. For still others, the quality of education is poor because there are not enough well-trained teachers or school supplies. Students may not even learn basic reading or writing skills.

The number of children in danger of not going to school is higher than ever before. At the same time, money to help countries give their young people education in emergencies is very low. In 2013, out of every $100 in emergency money, only $2 of it went to education and learning opportunities. Learning is not only an important part of relief for every child in an emergency. It is also an investment in the future of their countries.

More Funds Needed For Schools

Over the last few months a group has been talking about raising money for education in emergencies. Much still needs to be discussed but the idea is gaining strength. We should build on that.

We face a choice that we must make together. Should we spend more now on education, or pay the price later? If we do not pay for schools, we will have a lost generation of poorly educated children. These children will someday not have enough knowledge from school to rebuild their broken communities. They will not reach their own dreams and will find it much harder to give their own children a chance at a better life. This will cost us all in the future.
