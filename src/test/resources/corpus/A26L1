KATHMANDU, Nepal — In April, a powerful earthquake shook Nepal.

The country is in the mountains between India and China.

Weeks after the earthquake, an American team of scientists arrived to measure the damage.

The team wanted to find out what happened to the rock and soil during the quake. They looked at which buildings, bridges and roads made it through the quake. They also looked at the ones that did not.

The best way to learn to build safer buildings is to go to disaster zones, said Binod Tiwari. He is an engineer at California State University, Fullerton. Tiwari helps lead the team from the United States. He was born in Nepal. Seeing what the earthquake did is especially important to him.

He wanted to see the buildings that failed.

“Natural disasters come without telling us,” said Tiwari.“Science has to chase that disaster.”

"Liquid" Soil And Landslide Risk

Tiwari studies soil liquefaction. This sometimes happens during earthquakes. It causes the soil to move like a liquid. Then buildings tip over as if the rug is pulled out from under them.

Across Nepal, the team saw people huddled under tents. Nearby, many houses were knocked over and crumbling.

“You want to cry” when you see that, Tiwari said.

The scientists need to work fast. Soon the summer rains, called monsoons, would come. The rains would wash away evidence from the earthquake. If this happened, the engineers would not be able to figure out what happened.

The team examined every bridge, road and building they came across.

The scientists also looked at how different types of soil reacted to the earthquake. Soil affects whether a building survives an earthquake. Tiwari and his team looked at the materials that made up different soils. They also looked at how tightly packed the soils were and how much water they held.

In part, they wanted to find mountain slopes where there is a high risk of landslide. They hoped to discover this now. It would help them know which slopes might crumble during the summer rains.

Making The Most Of An Aftershock

Tiwari and his team were on the road May 12 when an aftershock hit. Their car swayed as if rocked by ocean waves.

An aftershock is a smaller earthquake that follows a bigger one. The aftershock had a magnitude of 7.3. Magnitude shows how strong an earthquake is on a 1 to 10 scale. The big earthquake in April had a magnitude of 7.8.

The aftershock felt like “some big elephant coming to your car and shaking the car,” Tiwari said.

The team members did not even think of turning back. The aftershock gave them the chance to see the damage just hours after an earthquake.

There was a lot of damage near the center of the aftershock. Homes made with mud and bricks had fallen apart.

Tiwari said scientists will have to study the soil in different areas around Nepal. They need to understand where it is safe to build.

His House Survives The Quake

Years ago, Tiwari had just finished college. He built his own house in Nepal. He designed it so well that it survived the quake.

His mother still lives there. She and her neighbors were so scared that they would not return to their homes at first. They lived together in a tent for weeks as aftershocks continued.

Tiwari knew he needed to examine the buildings himself.

Tiwari checked everyone's house."Don’t worry, go back to your house and sleep well there,” Tiwari said. “And they did, they did."
