WASHINGTON — Hillary Rodham Clinton got a big shock recently. Clinton is the leading candidate in the Democratic presidential primary. If she wins the primary election she will run for president in the main November election next year. 

Yet the former secretary of state discovered that one of her Democratic rivals is catching up to her. At least in spending money.

Clinton's campaign team announced Wednesday that it had raised more than $28 million from July to October. That amount was almost matched by the $26 million raised by Senator Bernie Sanders. He represents Vermont as a senator in Congress.

Much of the money came from regular people who sent in small amounts of money.

Running For President Isn't Cheap

In the primary election, Clinton and Sanders will face off against other Democrats. The winner of the primary race will be in the national election. Then that candidate will run against candidates from other political parties, like the Republicans.

It takes much money to run for president. Candidates get most of it from donors. Some donors are rich people. Others are just average Americans. Candidates spend the donations on things like television ads and hiring campaign workers.

It is possible that Sanders might even end up with more money than Clinton.

His success in raising money could change the outcome of the primary election. It gives him a better chance of getting more votes. Until now, he has not been seen as a serious threat to Clinton.

Online Donating Gives Campaigns A Boost

Clinton has held dozens of expensive events to raise money. She has also asked for online donations. Her campaign's goal is to raise $100 million by the end of the year. Campaign workers said she is on track to reach her goal.

Workers for Sanders are amazed at how close the two campaigns are.

"I think it's remarkable that Bernie Sanders was able to raise almost as much money as Hillary Clinton," said Tad Devine. He is a campaign expert helping Sanders.

Both campaigns are still trying to raise as much money as they can. Late Wednesday, one Sanders supporter tweeted: "There's still time." Former President Bill Clinton wrote in an email: "Will you help elect her by donating $1 before midnight tonight?"

Shortly after midnight, a Sanders worker said his campaign had raised more than $2 million online just on Wednesday. About $500,000 of that came in after 10:30 p.m.

In all, Clinton has raised $75 million. Sanders has raised more than $40 million.

Spending Wisely

Sanders is being careful with his campaign money. He has not yet started putting ads on television, even though Clinton has.

Sanders thinks that rich people have too much say in the government. Sanders would like the United States to be more like Europe. Sanders wants to give everyone health care and free college, like many European countries do. He is trying to raise money over the Internet, mostly in small amounts.

Sanders has mainly avoided people with a lot of money and fancy fundraisers.

Unlike most other presidential candidates, Sanders also does not want help from Political Action Committees. These PACs are groups that are not part of the campaigns. Yet they can raise an unlimited amount of money to help their favorite candidates.

Clinton has also said she does not like the influence of rich people on government. However, she is accepting the backing of two super PACs working to help elect her. The main group is Priorities USA Action. It has raised $15.6 million for Clinton in the first half of the year. It has promised $25 million more.

Devine said the Sanders campaign decided not to try to compete with Clinton in one area. It will not match Clinton's spending on television ads early in the campaign. It wants to save money for when it needs it. "We wanted to have as big a pile of cash on hand," he said.
