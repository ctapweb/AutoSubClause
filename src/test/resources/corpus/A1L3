MILWAUKEE, Wis. — Outer space is getting a little closer for some lucky students, thanks to two professors from the University of Wisconsin-Stout.

The professors re-created the dusty surface of Mars to help their students learn about what it takes for life to flourish on the planet. They constructed an area to resemble Mars in a dirt lab and a greenhouse on the university campus in Menomonie, Wisconsin. Their goal was to help students explore the plot of “The Martian,” Hollywood’s blockbuster space movie, and learn about science at the same time.

It wasn't easy to create the Mars-like surface. The professors gathered about 400 pounds of subsoil — dirt that is under the top soil you see on the ground — from nearby. They cooked the soil at 1,000 degrees for about two hours to kill off any type of life that was growing within it.

Then they challenged their students to figure out how to grow potatoes in the reddish-orange soil. The Mars-like soil didn't have any of the nutrients that Earth naturally contains that makes growing plants easy. It was similar to what Mars is really like in that way.

Playing What-If To Fit The Pieces Together

This was a hands-on experience for the students, who got their hands dirty. They did not learn by memorizing facts and definitions of soil science. Instead, they faced a difficult problem and had to think critically to solve it. Then they played the what-if game as they began to understand how all the pieces fit together.

“It’s like taking a fun toy apart to see how it works, and then putting it back together,” said Matt Kuchta, a UW-Stout professor who teaches the soil science and conservation class.

“The Martian,” stars Matt Damon as an astronaut stranded on Mars. It is based on a 2011 science fiction novel by Andy Weir. Both the book and movie include elaborate and accurate technical details. But there are parts about Mars that are not scientifically true.

In the movie, Damon is both an astronaut and plant expert. When he gets stuck on Mars he tries to grow food, despite the fact that Mars is famous for being unfriendly to all types of life. He uses various things, from food scraps to his own waste, combined with a little bit of water, to help plants to grow. His goal is to survive until he can be rescued.

"Martian" Soil — From Chippewa County

Kuchta, the professor, started reading the book the movie is based on last January. He realized that the plot was actually pretty scientific.

“It struck me as a perfect theme to help students understand concepts of soil science, and not just rural agriculture," Kuchta said.

Kuchta actually got the idea to construct the Mars surface for his students from his father. His dad teaches high school chemistry and biology, the study of life. Kuchta used glacial subsoil from nearby Chippewa County, which he then heated to high temperatures. The subsoil is full of sand, gravel, silt and clay, which were left behind by melting glaciers tens of thousands of years ago

Mandy Little, a professor of biology, also helped with the experiment. She is married to Kuchta.

Her students used composted garden soil, made of leaves and vegetable scraps that had broken down over weeks. They added the composted soil to the Mars-like soil to try to grow potatoes. They faced many challenges, including the fact that many of the potatoes rotted because of diseases in the composted soil.

“It’s all about understanding how the system works and being able to make predictions based on how the soil system will respond to various changes,” Kuchta said.

Everything Is Connected

Earth’s soil system is part of the larger biosphere in which all living things are found. The soil system is connected to the atmosphere. Gases, rain and rocks are all connected, and the students learned about how they affect one another.

Some students suggested adding hair to the soil because that's something that would be available to someone who was trapped on another planet. They also thought about adding food scraps and bits of clothing.

The students did not use human waste to fertilize the soil, like in the movie. Instead, they used worm droppings called casings.

Seeing The Role Of Science In Society

The first class assignment was to read the first chapter of the book online. The professors also showed their classes the trailer for “The Martian” movie.

“I want them to be interested in science and have it be accessible,” Little said.

Scientists do not have all of the answers when they first tackle a problem. They must do research, come up with theories and make decisions based on what information is available to them. Seeing how scientists reason through problems can help students understand the role science plays in society, she said.
