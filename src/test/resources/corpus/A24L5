When the world’s youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate walked onstage June 26 at San Jose State University to a standing ovation, her first words to the roaring crowd were “Thank you.” A 4,000-strong audience of young and old had gathered at SJSU Event Center to hear from 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai. Girls held her memoir emblazoned with the title “I Am Malala.” Parents whispered her story into the ears of their children.

In his introduction, Afghan-American novelist Khaled Hosseini said, “(The gunman) technically shot the girl he was meant to shoot. But in every other way, he shot the wrong girl.”

During the hourlong conversation with Hosseini, Malala showed off a wise and wisecracking side.

“There has always been this fear that if you give girls education, then girls will get out of control,” she said. “You have the right to education and you have the right to discover more in life.”

She added, “(In my family) my brothers think they are discriminated against, but I think that’s fine.”

As a precocious 11-year-old, Malala began pushing against the laws in the conservative, Taliban-occupied region of Swat Valley, Pakistan. According to McClatchy, she emerged as a public figure after it was revealed that she was the voice behind “Gul Makai,” the pen name of a BBC Urdu blog detailing life under Taliban rule from the perspective of a young girl forbidden to go to school.

On Oct. 9, 2012, when Malala was 15, the Taliban attempted to silence her words forever — with three bullets. The attack captured the world’s attention as Malala was airlifted for brain surgery at a military hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan, and then to England. Since her miraculous recovery, Malala has continued her crusade for girls' education working through her nonprofit, the Malala Fund, and earning the world’s stage to speak about her mission as the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize with Indian children’s rights activist Kailash Satyarthi.

On Friday, Malala brought perspective from the lives of her Pakistani peers to a Silicon Valley audience. She described the pervasiveness of gender discrimination and how it filters down to dinner-table politics. “Boys would get the chest piece and the leg piece of the chicken, while girls would get the wings and the neck,” she said.

Malala's activism for girls’ education was grounded in the footsteps of her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, an education administrator who operated a chain of private schools. Malala spoke about her father’s dedication to ensuring access to education for all children. He welcomed 150 children who could not afford to pay tuition, despite the complaints and departures from other parents who didn’t want their children mixing with those from lower ranks of society.

“He’s always been an inspiring father,” Malala said, asking her father to stand up from his front-row seat. But like all 17-year-olds, she does bicker with him. “We had a fight in the car,” she told Hosseini.

The two writers spoke about the power of words. Hosseini became a best-selling author with his first novel, "The Kite Runner," about the friendship of two Afghan boys set against the backdrop of turmoil, from the overthrow of Afghanistan’s monarchy to the rise of the Taliban.

“The very first thing that was revealed to the prophet was the word 'read,'” Hosseini said, referring to Islam’s Prophet Muhammad. “I find it ironic that the word is used against women and girls.”

Hosseini then asked Malala why she decided to speak up through her blog and public appearances.

Her response demonstrated her courage and a seemingly clear-cut rational response to the challenges of living under the Taliban. “If you remain in silence, you will continue to live in terrorism,” Malala said. “Or you speak up. In both ways, the consequences are hard.”

The teenage activist is currently touring the U.S. with her father. Her nonprofit, the Malala Fund, is campaigning for countries to provide 12 years of free primary and secondary education for all children by 2030. The Malala Fund’s blog reports that on Tuesday Malala made her first visit to Congress where she met with lawmakers, including Senator John McCain and Representatives Kay Granger and Nita Lowey.

In her meeting with the congresswomen, who sit on the subcommittee overseeing the budget for global development and education, Malala emphasized the important role the U.S. plays in supporting the Global Partnership for Education. Malala also commended first lady Michelle Obama’s “Let Girls Learn” initiative.
