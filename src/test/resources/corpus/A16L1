CLEVELAND, Ohio — The race to become the next president of the United States is on. Everyone running for president is known as a candidate.

Right now, the race is very crowded. Seventeen Republican candidates have announced they are running. Republicans are one of the two main groups running. Democrats are the other.

17 Republicans Start Their Race

The race for president is in two parts. The first part is known as the primaries. Republican candidates run against other Republicans in the Republican primary. Democrats run against Democrats in the Democratic primary.

Then, the winner of the Republican primary runs against the winner of the Democratic primary. The second contest happens in 2016. It is known as the election. The people picked to run in that race are called the nominees. The winner of the election becomes president.



The Republicans are just beginning their race to see who will become the nominee. Last Thursday, the 17 candidates gathered together for the first time. They were divided into two groups. One group was made up of the 10 most popular candidates. The other group was made up of the seven less popular candidates. Popularity is decided by asking voters who they would vote for. It can change over time.

A Real Conservative?

The candidates spoke on TV. They came to show themselves to America. Each wanted to show that they are the best person to pick.

Most of the candidates attacked Donald Trump. He is the most popular candidate.

Some people feel Trump is not ready to be president. He has never been in charge of a state or city. He is a rich businessman. Mostly, he is famous for being on TV.

The other candidates said Trump is not a real conservative.

Conservatives like the old ways of doing things. They do not like change. The Republican Party has been getting more conservative.

"Win When We Unite People"

Most people thought Jeb Bush would be the most popular candidate. Bush was once the governor of Florida. His brother and his father have been presidents.

Many Republicans do not think Bush is conservative enough. On Thursday he tried to fight back.

“I governed as a conservative,” he said of his years as Florida's leader. “We left the state better off."

Bush also attacked Trump for the nasty things Trump has said about Mexicans. Many people feel what Trump said is unfair.

Trump's words divide people, Bush said. Talk like that is not good for Republicans, he added. “We’re going to win when we unite people.”
