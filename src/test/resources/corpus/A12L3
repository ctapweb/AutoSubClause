WASHINGTON, D.C. — Some states want to get kids away from computers and into the outdoors at state parks. The states are sponsoring activities for students, and governors are hosting campouts. The programs have two goals. They want to encourage youth to be more active and avoid obesity. They also want to teach kids to appreciate nature and support state parks.

“Young people need to have a healthy lifestyle and truly experience the nature of the world" and not some gaming device, said Lewis Ledford. He is executive director of the National Association of State Park Directors. Being outdoors will teach them it is important to protect the environment, Ledford said.

The parks are attracting more visitors, but they have smaller budgets with which to operate. Their costs have gone up, but funding from state legislatures has dropped in the last five years. Many parks have cut jobs or cut hours and programs. Some have boosted entrance and camping fees. They have also turned to donations from businesses or to raising money from state lottery sales for help.

Young Visitors Are More Likely To Return As Adults

Across the United States, more than 5,000 state parks and areas include historic sites and wildlife areas. More than 700 million people visit state parks each year, and that number keeps growing. Two-thirds of them bring children. Parks officials say children who do not visit parks are less likely to visit parks as adults.

If our future leaders do not experience nature, they will not care about protecting it, Nita Settina, of the Maryland Park Service, said. If parks provide fun adventures, children will become park visitors, she said. Someday, they will bring their own children, she added.

States such as Maryland and Virginia have created job programs for teens. They spend the summer working on the parks and enjoying the activities. Maryland has been running its jobs program for eight years. This summer, about 300 teens got paid to build trails, fix picnic pavilions, clean streams, plant trees and create butterfly gardens. They also spent part of their time canoeing, fishing and camping.

Teaching Teens About Nature With Jobs Programs

Most teens came from Baltimore or other urban areas and were not familiar with outdoor life. Many had never left their neighborhoods and it was the first time they had seen the Atlantic Ocean or been camping, said Settina, the park service chief. “It’s one of the most important things we do. It’s also one of the most gratifying,” she said.

Experts say there are many reasons why kids are playing outdoors less and are not in touch with nature. Studies say a big reason is that they’re hooked on technology. Kids spend about seven hours a day with electronic devices. They are watching TV and using computers and phones. They are indoors and not moving, which leads to more obesity among children.

The numbers of obese young children have doubled in the last 30 years. The number of obese teenagers is 4 times more than it was 30 years ago. In 2012, more than one-third of children and teens were overweight or obese. That is why state parks officials say they must provide programs to get young people outdoors.

New Mexico Takes Classroom To Great Outdoors

In New Mexico, the Parks Department runs an outdoor classroom program at state parks. Teachers train on subjects such as how to test water quality and spot insects and birds. They take their students to the parks for lessons.

The program is trying to preserve the heritage of New Mexico, said Christy Tafoya, the state parks director. It encourages young people to appreciate the parks and preserve them for the future.

New Mexico teachers and schools can apply for funds to pay for buses to take students to the parks. The money comes from the state's residents. They can choose to donate a portion of their tax refunds when they file their tax returns.

Unplugging From Electronics, Plugging Into Nature

Last month, the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, welcomed 10 families at Brandywine Creek State Park in Wilmington. As part of the Capital Campouts program, they set up tents and camped overnight. The families were mostly outdoor novices and new to the experience. The campers learned about owls, crickets and tree frogs and roasted s’mores by the campfire.

There is a whole generation of kids who grew up on video games, said Ray Bivens, director of Delaware State Parks. People are so connected to their electronic devices that they will not put them down and will not go outside, he said.

The parks have a duty to have programs that teach kids outdoor skills, he added. "Being able to identify a couple of stars in the night sky, they just love it.”
