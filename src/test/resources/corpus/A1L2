MILWAUKEE, Wis. — Some lucky students are getting a little closer to outer space, thanks to two professors from the University of Wisconsin-Stout.

The professors built an experiment to help their students learn about Mars. They re-created the dusty surface of the planet in a greenhouse to teach students about growing food on Mars. The idea came from the plot of the popular movie, “The Martian."

It was difficult to create the Mars-like surface. The professors gathered about 400 pounds of soil from deep in the ground. They cooked the soil at 1,000 degrees for about two hours. By cooking the soil, the professors killed off any tiny living things that were growing in the dirt.

Once they prepared the soil, the professors challenged their students to grow potatoes on the surface. It wasn't easy. The Mars-like soil didn't have the nutrients that Earth's soil contains.

Dig In And Get Dirty

It was a unique classroom experience. The students dug in and got their hands dirty as they tried to solve the difficult problem. They played a what-if game and tried to understand what it would take to grow food in the soil.

“It’s like taking a fun toy apart to see how it works, and then putting it back together,” said Matt Kuchta, one of the professors.

“The Martian” is a movie that stars Matt Damon. He plays an astronaut stranded on Mars. It is based on a 2011 science fiction novel by Andy Weir.

In the movie, Damon tries to grow food on Mars to survive. He uses various things, from food scraps to his own waste, and a little bit of water, to help plants grow.

Movie Plot Was Scientific

Kuchta, the professor, started reading the book the movie is based on last January. He quickly realized that the plot was actually pretty scientific. He thought it could be used to get his students thinking about Mars.

Kuchta thought it was a good way of helping students understand the ideas of soil science, and not just learn about farming.

Kuchta's dad helped him come up with the idea for the project. His dad is a high school science teacher. The soil that Kuchta used came from Chippewa County, Wisconsin. It is full of sand, gravel, silt and clay. Melting glaciers from thousands of years ago helped make the soil what it is today.

Trying To Understand How The System Works

Mandy Little is a professor of science. She also helped with the experiment. Little is married to Kuchta.

Her students used composted soil, made from vegetables and leaves that had broken down over weeks. They added the composted soil to the fake Mars soil to try to grow potatoes. They faced many challenges. Many of the potatoes rotted because of diseases in the composted soil.

Little said that for her students, it's "all about understanding how the system works." The students learned how to make predictions about how the soil would respond to various changes.

Earth’s soil system is one piece of the living world. All living things play a part in making the world survive. Gases, rain and rocks are all connected, and the students learned about how these affect one another.

Learning Science In An Enjoyable Way

The students tried different things to get the potatoes to grow. Some suggested adding hair to the soil because that's something that someone who was trapped on another planet would have. They also thought about adding food scraps and bits of clothing.

The first class assignment was to read the first chapter of the book online. The professors also showed their classes the trailer for “The Martian” movie.

Little said she wanted her students to learn about science in an enjoyable way.

Scientists don't have all of the answers when they begin tackling a problem. They must study, come up with theories and make decisions. Experiencing this for themselves gave the students the exciting opportunity to learn how science affects our society.
