SURAT, India — Their hands fly with the speed and skill of veteran assembly-line workers. They pause only to wipe sweat from their foreheads, constructing cardboard box after cardboard box.

These boxes, bound for sari shops in far-off cities, get stacked in multi-colored towers that loom over the small hunched-over workers.

Many of these workers are not yet teenagers, but they fill the dimly lit textile mills and warehouses here in Surat — an industrial city in western India.

Millions of Indian boys and girls work despite a law requiring children younger than 14 to be in school full time, human rights groups say. These groups estimate there are more than 50,000 child workers in Surat alone.

Balancing Education And Reality Of Poverty

India has declared that it wants to end child labor, but a new proposal from the government aiming to help children has been criticized. Advocacy groups say the proposal could actually push more youngsters into the workforce, jeopardizing their education and putting them at greater risk of exploitation.

The proposal would make it legal to employ children younger than 14 in a “family enterprise” that is not deemed hazardous. These changes were added to a 30-year-old law and approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government last month.

Under the proposed new rules, children would be banned from working in heavy industry, manufacturing fireworks, or other dangerous professions. Still, they could work in almost any other industry, as long the company was owned by relatives, and they worked outside of school hours.

Prime Minister Modi’s conservative government said it was trying to balance the need for education and the reality of poverty in India.

In many poor Indian families, boys and girls help their parents from an early age. Supporters of the proposal say banning all child labor could harm small farmers, shopkeepers, cooks and others who rely on small hands to help them scrape by.

The number of child laborers in India has fallen sharply over the last decade, according to census data. There were 12.6 million in 2001 and 4.3 million in 2011. Still, these numbers may not count many children working in family businesses.

"Child Labor Might Actually Increase"

Child rights advocates fear the new proposal could create a loophole allowing employers to hire children by calling them “family.”

In Surat, a fast-growing city of 4.6 million, the bosses of textile factories that make cloth regularly tell labor inspectors that the boys working in the factories are relatives.

Government surveys, though, show that many child workers in Surat are migrants from poorer states. Experts say the children don’t dare to disagree with their bosses. Authorities often lack the resources or willingness to investigate further.

“Family business sounds good, but what we have found is that bosses say, ‘I’m his uncle’ or ‘he’s my son,’ and law enforcement is not very keen to verify the claim,” said Chandrashekhar Deshmukh, head of the nonprofit Pratham Council for Vulnerable Children’s office in Surat.

“If this practice gets legal cover, child labor might actually increase,” he said.

A 2009 law in India mandates free, full-time schooling for all children younger than 14. Now, authorities are trying to change child-labor rules to match the education law.

The earlier labor laws in India banned children under 14 from working only in 18 hazardous industries.

The new proposals giving exceptions for family-businesses must pass both houses of Parliament and the largely ceremonial president. Experts say the proposals have a good chance at becoming law.

Proposed Rules Make Punishments Harsher

Trade unions representing the workers back the proposals. The unions are made up of people who represent the workers' best interests. They say the new laws would work well with International Labor Organization rules that require countries to set a minimum working age of at least 14 and prohibit employment that would damage a child’s health or well-being.

“It’s a very progressive amendment, and it is very clear,” said Vrijesh Upadhyay, general secretary of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, India’s largest labor union.

“Suppose I am a shopkeeper. My child comes after school and sits with me, he helps me — that’s allowed. If in any way he earns money, that is child labor and that will be punished,” Upadhyay said.

The proposed rules also make the punishments for employers breaking child-labor laws harsher. They could now face two years in prison and a $800 fine for their first offense. The proposal drops punishments for parents who break the rules once — acknowledging the struggles that cause child labor in the first place.

Educators say any regular work that takes away children's time to study or play can be harmful. They say it can be bad for their development and increase the likelihood that they will drop out of school. Farmwork exposes children to harmful pesticides. In Surat’s garment industry, which makes saris and other traditional Indian clothing, children work all-day shifts for as little as $1.50.

"Make In India" Campaign Cited

Last month, Surat authorities raided a restaurant. Two teenage workers from another part of India sat quietly in the administrator’s office at a government-run children’s home. Mahinder Rajaram, the youngest of nine children from a small village, said he had served tea and snacks for two months, earning about $35 each month.

Ramesh Khadsalia, a teacher at the home, said officials were trying to contact the boy’s family to send him home. But Khadsalia said there was a good chance that Mahinder would leave again to find work somewhere else. He had dropped out of school in fourth grade and did not even know how old he was.

Critics say the proposed changes send the wrong signal from Modi’s government. The country has been trying to promote foreign investment through a glossy campaign called “Make in India.”

“There is a feeling that if children are blocked from working, the garment industry or other industry might suffer,” said Prabhat Kumar, a child protection manager for the charity Save the Children.

“But if you really look at the issue, this won’t be the case. No one would support the idea of ‘Make in India’ meaning ‘Made by Children,’” he said.
