SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — Paul Brown sets out before sunrise to patrol Sacramento. He is looking for evidence that someone is wasting California’s water. It may be a damp sidewalk, or a flooded curb gutter, or a suspiciously damp driveway.

Every so often he catches a lawn-care violation in action. Sprinklers spraying on a city-mandated no-watering day, for example.

Brown usually gets away unnoticed after writing a warning to an offender. Early risers can make his job more difficult. He works for Sacramento's City Water Conservation Office. Two weeks ago a woman swore at him after he issued her a $50 fine. Homeowner Robin Sortman, watching Brown snap photos of his telltale wet pavement, asked why the city gets to decide which two days a week he can water.

“I’m not sure I understand the problem,” Sortman said, showing off his empty swimming pool. “I’m not able to enjoy my summer this year. I shower twice a week. We don’t flush the toilet every time. We use our water very minimally.”

California’s current drought is the worst the state has experienced in a long time. It has been going on for four years and seems like it will never end. It's really starting to get on people’s nerves. Authorities issued rules last month for cutbacks that Governor Jerry Brown ordered in April, marking the first time all the state’s 39 million inhabitants have been forced to conserve.

Residents Encouraged To Snitch On Others

Some are better at it than others. This is why there are water cops such as Brown. There are also hotlines and websites in cities including Los Angeles, Bakersfield and Stockton for homeowners to snitch on those being wasteful — which, according to city officials, they are enthusiastically doing.

“We’re in a really deep hole,” said Peter Gleick, co-founder of the nonprofit Pacific Institute in Oakland, which studies water issues. “There’s this feeling on the part of some, ‘Why are you asking me to do more when my neighbor has done nothing?’”

The water districts that supply nonagriculture customers must cut how much they supply from 2013 levels. They are cutting between 4 percent and 36 percent. This depends on how much water is usually used in the area. They must do this in order to achieve the statewide 25 percent reduction decreed by Brown. Farms are supplied by other water providers that have also had their water cut.

Outdoor Watering Restricted

A mix of steps is being taken to achieve the goal. For example, authorities are deciding when outdoor taps can be switched on. They are also imposing fines on residences or businesses that go over their monthly water allowance.

Some Californians are drought-shaming people who waste water. There is even a hashtag on Twitter: "#DroughtShame."

People post photos to expose wasters. They are taking the most interest in famous people and owners of mansions in places like Beverly Hills. Oprah Winfrey, Sean Penn and Kim Kardashian and her husband, Kanye West, have been in trouble for the greenness of their yards. The app for that is DroughtShame, which can be used to send pictures of water-wasting to authorities.

According to June Tangney, a professor at George Mason University in Virginia, it is unclear if shaming offenders changes their behavior. It does, however, "satisfy the desire for revenge,” she says. “It comes from a desire to punish.”

The app’s inventor, Santa Monica real estate broker Dan Estes, said his motivation was something else entirely. He fears for California’s future.

“You watch the news at night and you see pictures of the lakes that have dried up,” Estes said. “The next morning, you’re walking the dog and you see water all over the sidewalk." The two just don't make sense, he says.

Water Stolen From Neighbors

California has faced droughts many times throughout its history. One in the mid-1800s devastated the cattle industry. Another in the 1930s created tensions between Lake Tahoe property owners and people downstream in Nevada who cut a trench through the lake’s rim. They did this so more of its water would flow toward them.

In 2015, the same things are happening. In Madera County, near Fresno, some residents are stealing water from their neighbors. Water has become very valuable, said Madera County District Attorney David Linn. He recently set up a water-crime task force to investigate where people are stealing water. Some people are even taking it from fire hydrants.
