Mauna Kea rises broad-shouldered out of the waves of the Pacific. Lush forests blanket the mountain's base, while sparse clouds buffet its rocky upper slopes. A dormant volcano, Mauna Kea looms nearly 14,000 feet over the ocean's surface and more than 6 miles above the sea floor, making it the world's tallest mountain from base to peak.

It is a sublime mountain; everyone thinks so — environmentalists who prize its unique ecology, astronomers who gaze skyward from its peak, Native Hawaiians who consider its summit to be the dwelling place of gods.

But lately the peak has been a source of conflict. A proposal to install a revolutionary $1.4 billion telescope at Mauna Kea's summit has led to a bitter standoff among those who value it most. The fight has pitted scientists from some of the world's most powerful research centers against a small but determined group of activists.

As the controversy spread, it has evoked both anger and soul-searching about cultural sensitivity in the scientific community. Meanwhile, Hawaii residents are fiercely debating whether benefits brought by the project — jobs, tourism, a $1 million-per-year lease, unsurpassed views of the universe than we have ever seen before — outweigh the potential costs to their cultural heritage.

Gazing Infinitely Into Space

The telescope will see as much as 100 times farther and more clearly than any other telescope. It will allow astronomers to gaze deep into the universe's past and out toward it most distant reaches.

Lately, its opponents seem to be gaining ground. Work on the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) — named for the diameter of its enormous, light-gathering mirror — has been disrupted since workers broke ground on the project last fall.

Last week, hundreds of demonstrators crowded the road to the summit, waving flags and singing songs as construction vehicles attempted to inch past them. Some left boulders and stone altars, or ahu, in the middle of the road, while others camped at the construction site overnight. A dozen protesters were arrested and construction has been delayed.

The Hawaii Supreme Court is due to hear arguments in a case challenging the TMT's state-awarded permit in August.

Decades Of Debate

This is not the first time that Mauna Kea has been the focus of debate. Ever since 1968, when the first plans for a telescope were announced, construction there has been met with fierce opposition. Now there are 13 telescopes on the mountain, and many Native Hawaiians consider each of them a desecration.

That is because Mauna Kea is one of the most important natural landmarks in Hawaiian culture.

The mountain on the big island of Hawaii is considered to be the place where the sky and earth separated to form the heavens, and where the mother and father of the Hawaiian race first met. The mountain is home to more than 250 shrines and burial sites. In the past, its summit was so revered that only high chiefs and priests were allowed to ascend it.

"Mauna Kea in every respect represents the zenith of the Native Hawaiian people's ancestral ties to Creation itself," said Kealoha Pisciotta. She is a Native Hawaiian activist who helped bring the lawsuit against the TMT and is connected to both sides of the debate.

For more than a decade, Pisciotta worked as a technician on one of the mountain's telescopes. Meanwhile, she maintained a family shrine near the summit and led a cultural heritage group called Mauna Kea Anaina Hou.

"I have always supported astronomy," Pisciotta wrote. "However, I do not believe it is of so much importance that it should be allowed to overtake and destroy everything else in its wake."

Petition Incites War Of Words

Activists like Pisciotta believe that the telescope, which will be 18 stories tall and far larger than anything else on the summit, will ruin the mountain's beauty and spiritual power. They also say it will threaten the rare and fragile ecosystems that flourish there. Yet an environmental study found that not to be the case.

In April, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley emailed a petition in favor of the telescope to dozens of colleagues. It included an email from another scientist saying that "the Thirty-Meter Telescope is in trouble, attacked by a horde of Native Hawaiians who are lying about the impact of the project on the mountain and who are threatening the safety of TMT" workers.

The email, and the notion of Native Hawaiians as a "horde," prompted accusations of racism.

A column in The New York Times last October went even further. The writer called native activism like the telescope opposition a "turn back toward the dark ages."

Those accusations have only made Hawaiians angrier.

"Any time Hawaiians — or any other native people, for that matter — come out in force to push for more respect for our culture and language or to protect our places from this kind of destruction, we are dismissed as relics of the past," wrote Bryan Kamaoli Kuwada. He is a Native Hawaiian and a student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Culture, History Versus Science

The TMT is just the latest in a long line of scientific projects that have come into conflict with cultural groups. Often, the very qualities that make sites valuable to science, remote location and beautiful views, are what drew native worshipers to them in the first place.

In Mauna Kea's case, the mountain's history has some astronomers questioning whether this one is really worth it.

Emily Rice, an astrophysicist at the College of Staten Island who has used the mountain's Keck telescope, tweeted, "I'm not strictly pro or anti TMT. I really want it to be built (awesome science & engineering!), but not the way it's being done."

"Astronomy is awesome, but it's not life or death," read another tweet from Rice. "We can take the time to do things right & set an example."
