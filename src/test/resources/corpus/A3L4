GROVETOWN, Ga. — C.J. Pearson is in his grandparents’ kitchen when he unleashes his latest attack against Barack Obama. The Georgia teenager stares intently at a webcam as he questions whether the president is “ignorant” and “incompetent.”

Coreco JaQuan Pearson’s post could easily be ignored as the juvenile rant of a gawky 13-year-old in the midst of puberty. But his biting speech and in-your-face videos have earned him a place firmly on the Republican radar as a young African-American spokesman for a political party desperate to attract minorities.

The recording attracted more than 2 million views on YouTube in two weeks. C.J. has thousands of followers on social media like Twitter, and receives ample media attention.

As the head of Teens for Ted, he has rocketed to a role on Texas U.S. Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. That position also helps him push legislation that would allow younger Georgians to run for office.

Latching Onto A Rising Teenage Star

That fame has caused campaign officials and candidates to eagerly seek his support. At the same time, he has been under fire for strange and embarrassing falsehoods on social media. Also, his grandparents don’t agree with his political views and would rather he focus on school. And skeptics question whether outsiders are taking advantage of a bold and outspoken teenager.

“He is being exploited for his age and his race,” said Benjamin Dixon, a liberal African-American radio commentator in Boston. “He’s being propped up to say the things that conservatives want to say but cannot.”

C.J.’s grandparents, who have raised him since he was a baby, say that keeping him grounded is no easy task.

“What counts most is his education, and if he focuses most of his time on politics, he’s going to fall short,” said his grandmother, Robin Pearson. “He takes me for a spin, and we have to bring him back down to Earth to remind him we’re the adults and he’s the child.”

Plenty Of Attention To Turn His Head

C.J.'s email inbox is sprinkled with requests from TV producers and radio hosts, the latest being an invitation to be a guest on the television talk show The View. Classmates at his middle school call him Mr. President. And the lure of social media has been hard for him to resist.

Even when his grandparents discipline him when he misbehaves by taking away his devices, C.J. finds ways to get around the ban. He recently did a radio interview during an Internet timeout.

C.J. traces his interest in politics to a mock presidential election held in his second-grade class between Obama and John McCain — he voted for McCain, of course. Watching the debates and obsessing over what the candidates said taught him an important lesson.

“I’ve learned through time that at the end of the day, it’s not that hard to learn how politicians work,” he said.

A Republican Darling

He’s been in the national Republican spotlight since he was 12, when he claimed that he was dropped from Facebook for a video criticizing Obama. Facebook noted that it closed his account because its terms required users to be 13. It still went viral, and soon many conservative media outlets — searching for the next big right-wing thing — declared him a star.

As attention swelled, C.J. ran into trouble of his own making. He created a fake Twitter account under another name and used it to call himself a racial insult.

Not long ago, C.J. posted one of his most attention-grabbing posts yet: a screenshot pretending to be Obama’s Twitter handle blocking his account. His post quickly attracted tens of thousands of new followers and a tremendous amount of media coverage.

Except it wasn’t true. A White House spokesman denied C.J.'s claim — “nobody is or has ever been blocked from the @POTUS Twitter account.” It turned out to be a fabrication, although C.J. wouldn’t go into details about how it came about.

He calls it a teachable moment for a kid who aggressively sought the social media spotlight, only to learn it could burn him.

Learning Lessons In The Public Spotlight

“It’s hard. Being under the spotlight at 13 is hard. I’ve made mistakes. Most 13-year-olds make mistakes and they’re addressed at home. I make mistakes and they’re addressed by The Washington Post,” he said. “I’ve made mistakes that I hope others don’t, but you learn from them and you move on.”

In the last year, C.J. has kept busy by helping organize campaign events for many of Georgia’s top Republicans, and has made hundreds of calls and door-to-door visits.

C.J. next plans to run for chairman of the Georgia Teen Republicans, a group that supports the Republican Party. He would like the age for state House candidates to be lowered from 21 to 18 and for Senate hopefuls, from 25 to 21.

He has a private motive for that proposal, he acknowledges, as he describes his 30-year plan.

“School board at 18. State Legislature at 21. Run for Congress at 25. I’m tossing around the idea to run for governor or senator after that, and I’ll be older than 35 in 2040. It will be time to run for president.”

His grandmother, exasperated, just shook her head and said, “I’m just listening. He’s planned it out."
