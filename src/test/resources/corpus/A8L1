RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Things are getting better for women in Saudi Arabia. More and more of them are able to get jobs.

Saudi Arabia is very, very old-fashioned. For years, women were not allowed to work outside the home. They were only supposed to cook and take care of their children.

Now, things are changing.

Men still run women's lives in many ways. Women need their father's or brother's permission to go to school or marry. Still, more and more women are taking jobs. They are feeling stronger and happier.

Women Wear Long Black Robes

Saudi Arabia has rules about how women can dress. Women are supposed to cover themselves up when they go out. They do this so men will not see too much of their bodies. They dress in long black robes known as abayas. Some even cover their faces. Only their eyes show.

Women are not letting these clothing rules stop them, though. They are wearing their abayas to work.

It can still be very hard for Saudi women to find jobs. Many companies do not want women workers. Their bosses are old-fashioned. They think women should stay at home.

Men And Women In Different Spaces

There is also another problem. Saudi Arabia has strict laws against men and women mixing. Men and women are not allowed to spend much time together. The fear is that they will get into trouble if they do.

Companies want to follow these rules. Some also want women to be able to work. They are figuring out new ways of doing things. Their new ideas let women work without breaking the rules.

Some companies divide rooms in half with screens. Women work on one side, and men work on the other. At a few places, only women do the work. Other companies let women work from home on their computers.

It is still much harder for Saudi women to find work than it is for men. Only 1 job in 10 is held by a woman.

Still, people are getting used to the idea of women working.

There are now women working all across the country. Some of those women have even become bosses.
