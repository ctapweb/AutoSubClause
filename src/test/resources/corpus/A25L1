Six black churches have burned down. Nobody died in the fire.

Thousands of people are asking the same question. They want to know who is setting the fires. They also want to know why.

Investigators say only two of the fires were set on purpose. No one knows who set them. Also, no one knows if someone wanted to hurt black people. 

Officials Taking A Close Look

Six church fires within 10 days may not be unusual. Fires at churches happen all the time. Still, officials are taking a close look at each one.

Other people say the fires were not accidents. “Black churches are being set on fire,” one person tweeted on the Internet website.

“Black America is under attack,” another tweeted.

Each remark was re-tweeted hundreds of times.

Cornell William Brooks is the president of the NAACP. He shares their worries. The NAACP stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It is an important black civil rights group.

Shootings, Then Fires

People must pay attention to the church burnings, Brooks said. This is especially true after what happened in Charleston, South Carolina, he said.

On June 17, nine black people were killed in a church. A man named Dylann Roof was accused of the crime. Roof is a racist. He thinks that white people are better than blacks.

Brooks said the NAACP will work with churches and police. They will all make sure people in church are safe.

Jessie Parker is the mayor of Greeleyville, South Carolina. On Wednesday, Parker visited the ruins of a black church. It had burned down the night before.

Bad Memories Of Fires

“It gives you an ill feeling,” Parker said. “It brought back all those old memories." Twenty years ago, an anti-black group burned the church down.

Church fires happen all the time, said the National Fire Protection Association. The group keeps track of fires.

Most of the time they are accidents.

Sometimes, the churches are old. They are not in good repair. Some churches are hit by lightning. Also, fires can be started by kitchen stoves that were left on all night.
