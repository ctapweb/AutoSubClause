Vaughn Gray has become better at basketball. He can now "see the game slower," he said. He can "react to things" better during play.

Gray played forward for the Patriots. They are the basketball team at George Mason University (GMU) in Virginia. Gray no longer plays for the team. He has finished school.

Breathe Easy, Play Better

Gray says that breathing exercises helped his playing.

Gray first heard about the exercises back in 2013. He and his teammates learned about them in special classes.

The classes were part of a GMU study. The idea was to find out if learning mindfulness would help the Patriots.

Think About Now And Stay Calm

Mindfulness is a way of thinking. A mindful person only thinks about what he is doing at the moment. He does not let bad feelings get in the way.

A player's feelings can harm their game. If a player is too worried about losing, they may play badly. The same thing can happen if they are feeling angry.

Sports psychology is the usual way of dealing with this problem. Psychology is the study of people's feelings and thoughts. It looks at how feelings shape how people behave.

There is one big difference between sports psychology and mindfulness. Sports psychologists tell players to push bad feelings out of their mind. Players who learn mindfulness do not try to do that. Instead, they learn that it is OK to have bad feelings. They become calmer.

The GMU study shows that learning mindfulness can help players. It may help them more than sports psychology can.

Yoga: It's A Stretch

Mindfulness programs have been around for a while. The GMU study added something new, though: yoga.

Yoga is a type of exercise. It helps people stretch. It also teaches them better ways of breathing.

Fallon Goodman led the GMU study. She thought adding yoga would help keep the players interested. A mindfulness class is just 90 minutes of talking.

The Patriots all took eight mindfulness classes. They also took eight yoga classes. The players said they felt more relaxed after taking the classes. They also said they had become more mindful.

Many more players may soon learn to be mindful.

"A lot of other teams are interested," Goodman said.
