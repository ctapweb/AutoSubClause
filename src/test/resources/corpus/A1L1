MILWAUKEE, Wis. — Some lucky students are getting a little closer to outer space, thanks to two professors from a university in Wisconsin.

The professors built an experiment. The experiment helped their students learn about Mars. They made a surface that looked like the surface of Mars. Then they gave their students a challenge. The students had to try to grow potatoes on a surface like Mars. The idea came from the movie “The Martian."

It was not easy to make the fake Mars surface. The professors collected about 400 pounds of soil. Then they cooked the soil at 1,000 degrees for two hours. Cooking the soil was important. It killed off any tiny things that were growing in the dirt.

It also was not easy for the students to grow potatoes in this soil. Earth's soil is full of nutrients that help things grow. The fake Mars surface did not have any nutrients. It was just like Mars.

Students Learned By Doing

This experiment was a special way to learn. The students had a hard problem to solve. They were not sitting in desks, reading books and listening to the teacher. Instead, they were acting like scientists.

Matt Kuchta was one of the professors. He said it was like taking a toy apart and then putting it back together. The students learned how things worked from the inside.

“The Martian” is a movie that stars Matt Damon. He plays an astronaut who is stuck on Mars.

In the movie, Damon tries to grow food on Mars. There is no life on Mars. He must grow something to live. He tries different things. He uses pieces of food, his own waste and water to help plants to grow.

Kuchta's dad helped give him the idea for the project. His dad is a high school science teacher.

Hair, Clothing, Food Scraps All In The Mix

Mandy Little is a professor of science. She worked with Kuchta on the project. They are married.

The students tried different things to get the potatoes to grow. Some suggested adding hair to the soil. Hair would be something that someone trapped on another planet would have. They also thought about food scraps and bits of clothing.

For homework, the class had to read part of the book. The professors showed some of the "Martian" movie in class, too.

“I want them to be interested in science,” Little said.
