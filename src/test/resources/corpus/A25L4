Thousands of social media users are tweeting a single question: who is burning black churches?

Fires at six black churches in the South over the last 10 days have stirred fears that racial violence on houses of worship is again on the rise.



Confederate Flag Links?

Many wonder if the fires may have been set because of criticism of the Confederate flag. Last month, a white supremacist, who thinks white people are superior to blacks, was charged with murdering nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. The man was later shown in a photo holding the flag, a symbol of the Confederacy that fought the Civil War to keep slavery in the American South.

For many, the flames are a haunting reminder of terrorism by white supremacists from decades ago.

The fires also reignited an army of activists who formed last summer during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer killed an unarmed black teen.

The passion of the activists for justice has been a regular presence after police shootings.

Two Arsons Confirmed

This week, the activists' focus has been on church fires. But investigators say only two of the six blazes have been confirmed as arsons. Investigators have not said that any of the churches were burned because their members are black.

“We are in the early stages of these investigations. But at this time we have no reason to believe these fires are racially motivated or related,” according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is investigating.

Some data suggest the number of church fires may not be that unusual.

On Twitter, it's a different story.

“Stop the passive language. Fires aren’t ‘breaking out’ at black churches. Black churches are being set on fire,” one person tweeted.

Activists On Twitter

“At what point are we allowed to say black America is under attack?” tweeted another.

“If the government watched the KKK as hard as they do #BlackLivesMatter, maybe we would know #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches,” tweeted a third. The KKK, or Ku Klux Klan, is a white supremacist organization.

Each remark was retweeted hundreds of times.

Their concerns were backed by Cornell William Brooks, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a black civil rights organization.

“The spike in church burnings in Southern states over the past few days requires our collective attention," he said Wednesday.

This is especially the case, he said, because of the June 17th church shooting in Charleston.

"We Cannot Turn A Blind Eye"

“When nine students of Scripture lose their lives in a house of worship, we cannot turn a blind eye to any incident,” Brooks said.

“As we wait for authorities to conduct their investigations, the NAACP and our state conferences across the country will remain vigilant," Brooks said. He said the group will work with local churches and police to make sure all the necessary steps are being taken to keep churches safe.

In the 1990s, a surge of church arsons — especially against black churches in the South — led to tougher arson laws. They also led to the creation of a church arson task force made up of federal and local officials.

The National Church Arson Task Force investigated 827 arsons, bombings or attempted bombings at religious buildings between 1995 and 1999. It found that at least 269 involved black churches, 185 of them in the South.

"An Ill Feeling"

That ugly time remained fresh in the mind of Greeleyville, South Carolina, Mayor Jessie Parker. On Wednesday, he visited the smoldering remains of the city’s Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church after a fire destroyed it the night before.

Twenty years ago, members of the Ku Klux Klan burned Mount Zion AME. Then-President Bill Clinton toured the church after it was rebuilt and said, “We cannot let someone come into our democratic home, the home of our faith, and start torching our houses of worship.”

On Wednesday, Parker urged patience as investigators worked to determine the cause of the latest fire. “It gives you an ill feeling,” he told reporters. “It brought back all those old memories.”

Church fires happen all the time, according to fire data gathered by the National Fire Protection Association. Adding in funeral home blazes — which the association does in its data — there were as many as five such fires a day across America in 2011, about half as many as in 1980.

"Potential For Copycats"

Sometimes, the churches are old and not maintained well. Also, steeples present a target for lightning, and stoves may have been left on after people left the building.

In 2011, the country saw an average of about five arsons a week at church and funeral homes, according to the fire association’s data.

The culprits often are teenagers and the fires are small, said Marty Ahrens, who is with the association.

“For some people, places of worship, maybe they’re like schools, a place of authority for kids” to target, Ahrens said. “Some of the arsons are just plain vandalism.”

So are the recent black church fires a trend or are the news media just paying more attention?

“It’s hard to know,” Ahrens said, adding that reporters might contribute to the problem.

“Right now, I am afraid that there is the potential for copycats,” he said. “I understand that you need to tell stories and publicize news, but there is a type of individual that can be motivated by doing something that gets wide coverage.”
