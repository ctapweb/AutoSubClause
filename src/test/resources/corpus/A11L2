FORT BENNING, Ga. — On Friday, the U.S. Army held a graduation ceremony for its Ranger School. Graduates of the Ranger School are some of the most highly trained soldiers in the Army. They are also some of the strongest. While it is a big accomplishment for anyone, this ceremony was extra special. For the first time in history, two women were graduating. This was an important day as the nation considers what types of jobs women should have in the military.

The ceremony took place at Fort Benning, Georgia. First Lieutenant Shaye Haver of Copperas Cove, Texas, and Captain Kristen Griest of Orange, Connecticut, became the first female graduates of the course. Ninety-four men graduated too.

The course is nine weeks long. It is very challenging for both men and women. Ranger School is hard on soldiers' brains and bodies. The course also tests leadership skills. Right now, women are limited in the types of jobs they can have in the Army. The government does not allow women to serve in certain combat jobs. Combat roles are dangerous and involve fighting.

Graduation Is A "Really Big Deal"

Griest, 26, is a military police officer. Before Ranger School, she served one tour in Afghanistan. Haver, 25, is a helicopter pilot. Both graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Of 19 women who began the Ranger course, Haver and Griest are the only two to finish so far.

General Mark Milley is the Army's new chief of staff. He told reporters at the graduation that he is proud of all the Rangers who completed the course. He said it was a "really big deal" for the Army and for women to have Griest and Haver graduate.

Griest realizes what their success means. She hopes their experience will help other women. She told reporters she wants other women to believe they "can deal with the same stresses and training that men can."

Some Think Women Have It Easier

Still, others are unsure. Some people think the military makes it easier for women to pass the Ranger course than it is for men.

James Lechner is a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former Ranger. He questioned whether the Ranger course tests women in the same way it tests men. He wonders if female students have to take the same types of tests as men. Lechner believes all soldiers should be held to the same standard and that Rangers need to be better than average. He said the Army needs the best soldiers it can possibly get.

One former Air Force pilot, Janine Davidson, was thrilled by Griest and Haver's success. She said it is time for the rules to change. Davidson said high school students are often "shocked" when they learn women cannot serve in all combat roles.

Most People Drop Out

Rangers call themselves "masters of special light infantry operations." They perform different and difficult military duties. Rangers are a branch of Army Special Operations Command and U.S. Special Operations Command.

The Ranger School is extremely hard. Most people who enter the course fail. Between 2010-2014, more than half of the students dropped out. Most failed within the first four days of the program. The course starts with a series of tests of physical strength, a land navigation course and a 12-mile foot march. Despite how grueling it is, Griest and Haver remind women across the country that it can be done.
