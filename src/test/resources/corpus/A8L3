RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — When she was a young woman, Sofana Dahlan decided she wanted to become a lawyer. She had a problem, though. In her native Saudi Arabia, universities did not allow women to study law. To follow her dreams, she had to go to Egypt.

Nearly 20 years later, Dahlan is an accomplished lawyer back home in Saudi Arabia.

Her career is evidence of a slow but significant shift in the ultraconservative Muslim kingdom.

Although women still need the permission of a male relative to attend university, get married or travel abroad, some are taking on new roles in the workplace. In the process, they are gaining some independence.

Women cloaked in black, some with only their eyes showing through face veils, are working outside the home more and more. They are working in shops and cafes, offices and boardrooms, and even on some factory assembly lines.

Women like Dahlan find it frustrating that the Western world does not seem to recognize this progress.

Cost Of Living, Internet Are Changing Attitudes

“No matter how successful we are, no matter how much we achieve, the world still chooses to see us as oppressed,” said Dahlan, who proudly wears the body-covering abaya. “In reality, a lot of us are not. We have limitations, but the whole world has limitations to different degrees.”

Saudis say changing attitudes about women in the workplace are due to a number of factors, including the rising cost of living and the influence of the Internet. They also credit the modernizing efforts of the late King Abdullah. The king paid for tens of thousands of young people of both sexes to study abroad each year.

Khalid Alkhudair's sister received a Western education, but had trouble finding work when she returned home. To help people like her, Alkhudair founded a job recruitment agency for women, called Glowork.

Many Saudi couples are finding that they need two incomes to afford the lifestyle they want. At the same time, companies are under pressure from the government to hire more Saudis, rather than hiring foreigners.

Country Wants To Hire Fewer Foreigners

The so-called Saudization program is an attempt to reduce unemployment among the growing number of young Saudis entering the workforce. It has ended up opening doors to women.

The kingdom still has strict laws on segregating the sexes in public. However, employers are finding ways to work within these rules.

Companies are putting in screens to create separate work spaces for women. A few have entire manufacturing plants staffed by women, while others are experimenting with allowing women to work by computer from home.

Progress has been slow, however. Although women now make up more than half the kingdom’s university graduates, they account for just 13 percent of the positions held by Saudis in the government and private businesses.

Government Eases Rules, Offers Training

Saudis typically look to the government for work. For women, that usually means jobs in schools and hospitals — but there are not enough of those to meet the demand. So the government has been easing restrictions and sponsoring training to help women find other kinds of jobs.

Glowork is also helping women find new kinds of jobs. Its recruiters conduct hundreds of interviews a week, matching job seekers with employers willing to hire women.

Every time the agency places a woman in a job, a gong is rung and the entire office applauds. Since the agency opened its doors four years ago, the gong has sounded thousands of times.

There has been resistance, however. When a local supermarket chain hired 11 female cashiers through Glowork, there was a public outcry. A prominent religious cleric, Youssef Ahmed, called on people to stop shopping at the stores, which he claimed were encouraging mingling between the sexes.

“They actually had to let go of these women because of the outcry,” Alkhudair said.

Women Now Accepted As Store Workers

The idea of women working in stores has gradually become accepted, however. The shift began with the demand that women be permitted to work in stores selling makeup and women's underwear.

Many Saudi women had long disliked having to buy such personal items from male shop attendants. They found it embarrassing and uncomfortable.

A law was passed in 2006 requiring that stores selling only to women hire female attendants. However, the law was not enforced, said businesswoman Reem Asaad.

After one particularly uncomfortable shopping experience, Asaad's patience finally snapped. A male clerk screamed at her for scraping a sticker off a package of underwear so she could see what style it was.

Asaad was furious at how she had been treated. When she got home she wrote a Facebook post calling on women to stop shopping at underwear shops that did not employ women.

Her post attracted a lot of attention and led to a broad campaign. Victory was achieved in 2011 when King Abdullah issued a decree requiring the enforcement of the 2006 law.

There are now women working in shopping malls across the country, and not only in the Victoria’s Secret stores. “There are even more women behind their desks and behind closed doors" running entire businesses, Asaad said.
