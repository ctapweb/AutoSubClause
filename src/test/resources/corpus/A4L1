WASHINGTON — Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for president. Clinton is the most popular Democratic candidate. She used to be a senator and the secretary of state.



Clinton got a big shock last week. She discovered that another candidate is catching up by raising lots of money.

The Democratic Party is a political group. President Barack Obama is a Democrat. The Republican Party is the other big group. Republicans usually disagree with Obama.

Elections Cost A Lot Of Money

Clinton raised more than $28 million from July to October. Her main rival is Bernie Sanders. He is a senator from Vermont. He also wants to be president. Sanders raised $26 million in the same time.

Clinton and Sanders are both competing in the primary race. They will go up against other Democrats. The winner of the primary race will be in the national election. That person will run against candidates from other groups.

It takes a lot of money to run for president. Candidates get most of it from donors. Any one can donate money. Candidates spend much of the money on television ads.

Sanders might raise even more money than Clinton. The money could make a big difference. It would give him a better chance of winning.

Big Money Goals

Clinton wants to raise $100 million by the end of the year. Campaign workers said it could happen.

Workers for Sanders are amazed at how much money he raised.

Both campaigns were still asking people for money. One Sanders supporter recently tweeted: "There's still time." Former President Bill Clinton wrote an email. He asked people to help elect his wife. He asked them to each give $1 to her campaign.

So far, Clinton has raised $75 million. Sanders has raised more than $40 million.

Careful Spending

Sanders is being careful with his campaign money. He has not put ads on television yet. Clinton already has ads on TV.

The Clinton campaign has held fancy events to raise money. People have to pay a lot to go to them. Sanders mostly avoids rich people. He also does not hold expensive events. He raised much of his campaign money over the Internet.

Sanders plans to spend less money on TV ads early in the race. He wants to save the money for when he really needs it.
