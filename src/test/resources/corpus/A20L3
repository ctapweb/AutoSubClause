HERSHEY, Pa. — Eugene Toner has been learning how to restore antique cars. Today, the 24-year-old student has a problem. He had just tried to start up a 1916 Scripps-Booth Model D automobile. The engine sputtered and coughed, but would not catch. Toner is at The Elegance, one of the nation's most important antique automobile shows. The beautifully restored cars are expected to run, not just look pretty.

Toner's teacher lifted the hood and made an adjustment. A few tense moments later, the Scripps-Booth roared to life. Toner pulled out of his spot and began a triumphant ride around the show grounds.

Driving Like It's 1959



You have to expect some car trouble when your ride is a one-of-a-kind like the Scripps. After all, it had not been driven since 1959. It sat idle for years until students at Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport got hold of it this spring and got it back on the road.

"I can't say enough about our students' passion," said teacher Roy Klinger.

Enthusiasm is what the hobby desperately needs from young people right now.

In 2012 Penn College began an antique vehicle restoration major. It became one of just a handful of schools teaching young people how to restore and maintain North America's fleet of more than 10 million old cars.

Passing The Wrench To The Next Generation

Fans of antiques cars are worried that not enough young people are learning how to fix the aging automobiles. All-important skills like metal shaping and upholstering might be lost unless more young people become restorers. The multibillion-dollar antique car industry recognizes the problem of its aging workforce. It has been giving large amounts of money to training programs and scholarships.

The efforts are beginning to pay off. The first graduating class at Penn College had eight students, and 23 more are on track to complete the program next year. McPherson College in Kansas also reports increased student interest. Their much larger auto restoration program has been around for nearly 40 years.

Students who learn to restore old cars usually have a job waiting for them.

"There are jobs everywhere, because people are retiring," said Diane Fitzgerald of America's Car Museum in Tacoma, Washington.

His Heart Is Racing

As a high school student, Jay Rhoads wanted to work on old cars for a living. However, his guidance counselor told him to consider auto restoration as a hobby, not a career.

Rhoads took her advice. He joined the National Guard and served in Afghanistan, then got a degree in criminal justice. Eventually he realized he did not want a career in law enforcement — he wanted to work on cars.

So Rhoads signed up for Penn College's auto restoration course. This spring, he found himself under the hood of a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 with a powerful, growling, 450-horsepower engine.

"Just sitting behind the wheel and starting it up is enough to make your heart race," said Rhoads, 27.

They Don't Make These Anymore

Across the shop sat the century-old Scripps-Booth. The black town car was built to order for Eleanora Sears, a tennis star and descendant of Thomas Jefferson. It cost her $17,500 — more than $380,000 in today's dollars.

The Scripps' uniqueness posed a challenge for the student restorers. Coming from a museum, it was already preserved as far as its appearance went. However, "there was no manual, no book, no resource that we could lean on to make this car run," said teacher Shaun Hack.

So the students did the best they could. They replaced worn parts and tinkered with the engine. Finally, on the last day of class, they got the engine to fire for the first time in more than 50 years. Talk show host Jay Leno, a noted car collector, came calling and took the Scripps for a spin.

Stealing The Show

Weeks later, the newly road-worthy Scripps took its place at The Elegance. Altogether, 74 of the world's finest automobiles went on display, drawing large crowds. The 1964 Aston Martin driven by James Bond in the movie "Goldfinger" was there. A huge 1949 Daimler DE36 won Best in Show.

The students who had restored the Scripps-Booth stood by it at the show, dressed in the sort of clothes worn in 1916. They chatted with show-goers who stopped to admire the Scripps, take pictures and ask questions. The Scripps ended up receiving an award.

As he gave out the award the show's announcer praised the students' work.

"It's nice to see somebody under 100 that likes (antique) cars," he joked.
