SANTIAGO, Chile — Tucked between high-rise buildings on a busy street in Santiago is a straw hut. Its presence in the busy city is a sign of growing respect for the Mapuche, Chile's long-scorned native group.

Sick patients line up to see the Mapuche herbalist inside, a kind of native pharmacist who mixes herbal cures. She is part of a government program to include traditional knowledge in Chile's public health system.

The Mapuche are one of the native peoples of Chile, living there for more than 1,000 years before the Spanish conquered the area in the 1500s.

Mapuche culture, long looked down upon in Chile, is slowly becoming fashionable.

"I'm not Mapuche, but I believe in their culture," said Elba Soto, 56. She often comes to the ruka — a traditional Mapuche thatched home — looking for herbs and ointments to ease the pain in her bones. "And I love all of it."

Fashion, Food, Music Make Their Mark

The geometrical designs of the Mapuche have made their way into fashion shows from New York to Paris. Their food is inspiring high-end restaurants. Popular singer Ana Tijoux waves the multicolored Mapuche flag during her concerts and also raps about their struggle on her albums, which have been nominated for Grammy awards. Television stations even compete with shows about the Mapuche, the country's largest native group.

The Mapuche are cool, said Pedro Cayuqueo, a Mapuche and host of "KulMapu." The popular TV show covers everything Mapuche.

Mapuche means "people of the land" in their original language. They resisted invaders for centuries. First they stood up against the mighty Incan empire and then the Spanish conquistadors.

The Mapuche ultimately won recognition of their right to everything south of the Bio Bio river, roughly the southern half of the long, thin country.

Settlers Took Mapuche Lands

But in the late 1800s, a new wave of European settlers arrived, and the treaties were broken. Mapuche lands were seized in violent takeovers.

Today, there are more than 1 million Mapuche. Most of them live in the area around Santiago, Chile's capital, and in their ancestral home in Araucania, the country's poorest region.

As a group, they are far poorer and less educated than other Chileans. They also tend to be sicker, be poorly fed and suffer from discrimination.

Even with the return of some lands in recent years, the Mapuche hold a small fraction of the lands they controlled before the Europeans arrived.

An extreme group of the Mapuche in Araucania has occupied and burned farms and lumber trucks to demand the return of lands. Police have been accused of storming into Mapuche homes and shooting rubber bullets at women and children.

Curiosity Grows About Native Culture

Most Chileans and Mapuche reject the violence. However, the conflict has drawn attention to their demands and created interest in their culture.

Cayuqueo said young Mapuche are curious about exploring their culture. They no longer deny they are Mapuche the way their ancestors did to avoid discrimination.

Authorities in Chile also are trying to encourage the culture of native — also called indigenous — peoples. Last month, the government hosted the first tournament of native soccer players from all over Latin America. This month, it launched a program to train professors to teach the original Mapuche tongue, Mapudungun, which is still spoken by many.

At the hut in Santiago, herbalist Natalia Ojeda Hueitra said she sees improvement in how Mapuches are treated.

"Before, there was a lot of discrimination, lots of people looking down at us, and many saw the Mapuche as the lowest of the low," said Hueitra. She wears the traditional "trapelacucha," a large silver collar that spreads to the chest. "Not anymore. Today, it's about empowerment."

Restaurant Named One Of World's Best

You'll find the influence of the Mapuche culture on the menu at Borago restaurant, recently named one of the best restaurants in the world. Borago uses traditional cooking methods, such as cooking in the ground with live coals. The restaurant also uses ingredients such as maqui, a berry that comes from a tree that is sacred to the Mapuche.

"We're cooking the native cuisine of Chile," said Rodolfo Guzman, Borago's chef and owner. "We're the continuation of the Mapuche."

VOZ, a New York fashion design company, works with Mapuche weavers in Chile and sells their hand-woven designs as far away as Asia and the Middle East. They've been displayed in Los Angeles and Paris and in New York fashion shows.

The Mapuche work "is so beautiful and so expertly crafted," said VOZ founder Jasmine Aarons. "And the stories that the Mapuche artisans tell in their artwork is so powerful, like their culture."

Chilean state television recently began broadcasting a historical drama called "Besieged: The Other Side of the Conquest," which focuses on the battle of Curalaba in 1598, a famous victory by the Mapuche against the Spanish.

"What's happening shows that Mapuche people have a lot of wisdom to share," said Mapuche leader Hugo Alcaman. "We're proud of being indigenous because we know of the wisdom that we have to offer to the world."
