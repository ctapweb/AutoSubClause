BAGHDAD, Iraq — Extremists from the Islamic State group have caused a global outcry by attacking ancient sites and monuments with jackhammers and bulldozers. All the while, they have been quietly selling off smaller items from Iraq and Syria in an increasingly organized looting of national treasures. These sales have brought in tens of millions of dollars, according to officials and experts.

Islamic State is an extremist group. It has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It wants to set up its own country governed by Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and some of northern and western Iraq.

The Islamic State group has defended its destruction of cultural artifacts by saying they are symbols of idol worship and represent pre-Islamic cultures. Yet behind the scenes, the group's looting has become so systematic that Islamic State has incorporated the practice into the structure of its self-declared religious state, or caliphate. It has granted licenses for digging in historic sites through a department of "precious resources."

The growing business reflects how the Islamic State fighters have entrenched themselves since seizing the Iraqi city of Mosul a year ago.

Antiquities In Danger

The extremist group's recent capture of Syria's majestic 2,000-year-old ruins at Palmyra threw a spotlight on the risk that the group poses to the region's rich cultural heritage, or history. It is however, just one of 4,500 sites under the control of the militants, according to the Financial Action Task Force, an organization based in Paris. The FATF tracks the movement of money that is used to pay for terrorist activity.

"They steal everything that they can sell, and what they can't sell, they destroy," said Qais Hussein Rasheed. He is an Iraqi official in charge of items from the ancient past, or antiquities.

"We have noticed that the smuggling of antiquities has greatly increased since last June," he added. June was the month in which Islamic State fighters took control of Mosul and large parts of northern Iraq.

At that time, extremists also seized the ancient city of Nineveh. In a video released earlier this year, the Islamic State group showed its fighters drilling off the faces of the mighty stone-winged bulls on the gates of the city. The fighters also filmed themselves destroying statues at Mosul's museum. However, many of the items they destroyed were actually copies of antiquities kept in Baghdad, Iraqi officials said. Anything genuine and small enough to move was likely sold off or stored by the group, they said.

World Heritage Sites Lost Forever

Iraq has seen its historic sites pillaged for years as thieves have taken advantage of instability in the country. The destruction of the poorly guarded national museum in Baghdad after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 was decried around the world.

Islamic State's plundering began in a haphazard fashion when the extremists first gained a foothold in Syria. The trade has become more organized as the group has conquered territory.

The Islamic State group grants so-called licenses for the excavation of ancient sites. It does this through a department in its government that handles antiquities, according to documents from the group.

How much the Islamic State group earns from the sales is difficult to estimate, but Iraqi officials say it is their second-most-important business after oil sales. It has brought the group tens of millions of dollars.

Unknowingly Funding Terrorism

The extremist group has been struggling to maintain its oil sales in the wake of U.S. airstrikes that damaged its oil production. Now experts and officials worry that the group's focus might turn more to illegally digging up artifacts.

"It's a dependable source of revenue, which makes it very attractive, and it's surprisingly untapped," said Michael Danti, a professor of archaeology at Boston University. "Over time, we've seen ISIL and organizations like it increase their ability to draw revenue from these crimes."

Danti advises the State Department on the trade in stolen antiquities from Iraq and Syria. He said some looted items have made their way to U.S. and other Western markets — especially antiquities in the lower- and medium-price ranges, such as stone seals with ancient writing.

Larger items will probably go through a process that takes years and involves the forging of documents to suggest the items were obtained legally. To be traded legally, the items must have been excavated or exported before 1970, when a United Nations rule prohibiting trade in such cultural property began. However, the market is poorly regulated. The Archaeological Institute of America estimates that as much as 90 percent of classical artifacts in collections may be stolen antiquities.

Smaller items from Iraq and Syria are now widely sold online, said Deborah Lehr, the co-founder of the Antiquities Coalition. The group aims to end the theft of cultural items.

"There needs to be better education and better regulation," she said. "The public needs to know that by purchasing these items, people are potentially funding terrorism."

An Act Of Defiance

In Baghdad, officials say they are doing what they can to stem the flow, but the Islamic State group is utilizing decades-old smuggling networks.

During the first Gulf War in 1991, and uprisings that followed it, thousands of items were lost.

The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 brought more looting, with sites left completely unprotected. Thieves stole thousands of ancient objects from the national museum in Baghdad.

Iraq's Rasheed advocates a complete ban on the trade of all antiquities from the country. His office is near the national museum. It recently reopened to the public for the first time since 2003 in what officials described as an act of defiance against Islamic State destruction.

"The Iraqi people need to be able to witness their history, their diversity," Rasheed said. "What's happening is a tragedy."
