SANTIAGO, Chile — Santiago is a giant city with tall buildings. In the middle of it is a tiny straw hut.

Sick patients line up to see the woman inside the hut. The woman mixes herbs to make cures. She belongs to the Mapuche.

The Mapuche have lived in Chile for more than a thousand years. Chile is in South America. Santiago is its capital. The Mapuche lived in Chile long before white people arrived.

For many years, Chileans looked down on the Mapuche. Now, people are interested in their way of life.
