It Takes Hard Work

Gilbert Alarcon lives in Downey. He runs a printing shop there.

“When you think of Downey, you think of a step above," Gilbert said. "You work your way in here," he said. "We moved up the ladder. We never looked back.”

Gilbert said he was very proud when he moved to Downey. He also felt out of place there at first.

Gilbert had just moved into his new house. He wanted to wash his car.

At his old house, he parked his car on the grass to wash it. Gilbert did not want to do that in Downey. He thought his neighbors might get mad.

Gilbert started to wash the car in the driveway. Then he stopped and looked around.

Nobody else was washing their car. He changed his mind. He used the hose to water his grass instead. Then he took his car to the car wash.

“You have to step it up a notch," Gilbert said. You need to set an example for other Latinos, he said.
