FORT BENNING, Ga. — The first female soldiers to complete the Army's rigorous Ranger School pinned on their black-and-gold Ranger tab at a graduation ceremony Friday. The celebration capped off their history-making week and put a spotlight on the debate over the role women should play in combat.

At a ceremony on the shore of "Victory Pond" at Fort Benning, First Lieutenant Shaye Haver of Copperas Cove, Texas, and Captain Kristen Griest of Orange, Connecticut, graduated alongside 94 male soldiers.

The women captivated the nation after finishing a grueling nine-week training program that is designed to test the limits of young soldiers' leadership and physical strength. The Pentagon is currently deciding whether or not to permit women who meet military standards to hold combat roles in the military.

Haver and Griest's success shines some light on the obstacles that women in the military face, especially those who aspire to join all-male combat units, including the 75th Ranger Regiment. Although they are both now Ranger-qualified, no women are currently allowed to join this elite regiment. However, officials say it is among special operations units likely to be opened to women eventually.

Graduating Women Are Pioneers

Griest, 26, is a military police officer and has served one tour in Afghanistan. Haver, 25, is a pilot of Apache helicopters. Both are graduates of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Of 19 women who began the Ranger course, Haver and Griest are the only two to finish so far; one is repeating a prior phase of training in hopes of graduating soon.

Addressing the graduates, the commencement speaker, Major General Scott Miller, congratulated all 96 graduates. He said he believed that all of the solders, regardless of their gender, met the Ranger standards.

"You'll leave Victory Pond today with a small piece of cloth on your shoulder, but more importantly you carry the title of Ranger from here on out," he said. Miller is commander of all Army infantry and armor training and education, including the Ranger School.

The Army opened Ranger School to women for the first time this year as military leaders weighed the decision of opening more combat jobs to women.

General Mark Milley, the Army's new chief of staff, told reporters at the graduation that he is proud of all the Rangers who completed the course and appreciates the importance of the pioneering performance of Haver and Griest.

"It's a really big deal" for them and for the Army, he said.

And while he praised Haver's and Griest's accomplishments, Milley said he has not yet decided whether to recommend that all Army positions be open to women.

Still, he said, "the Army can adapt. It has and will continue to adapt."

Do Women Have An Easier Time Of It?

Griest told reporters Thursday she hopes her success shows that women "can deal with the same stresses and training that men can."

Still, some current and former military members feel strongly that the Pentagon is unfairly accommodating women.

James Lechner, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former Ranger, said he questions whether the Ranger course tests men and women in the same way. He wondered whether the course adequately tested the female candidates under combat-simulated conditions. With that in mind, he is not sure whether it makes sense to open all combat units to women.

"American women certainly serve with honor and distinction, provide some capabilities that males may not be able to provide," Lechner said. "But when you talk about your fighting units, your combat arms units, especially the infantry ... you don't need to just have the minimum standards. You need to have as good as you possibly can get."

Janine Davidson, a defense policy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Air Force cargo plane pilot, said Griest and Haver's success in the Ranger program is a significant military milestone. She said their success and the prospect of the Army fully integrating women into its ground combat force is "policy catching up with reality." Considering that many women have had extensive combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, the reality is that women are already on the front lines. The debate also reflects a generational change, Davidson said, as she has even heard high school students have conversations about women's role in the military.

"They actually are shocked when they learn that women aren't already doing this kind of stuff — the idea that they themselves would not be allowed to do it," Davidson said this week.

Almost 60 Percent Of Candidates Drop Out

Rangers call themselves "masters of special light infantry operations," including seizing key terrain and infiltrating hostile territory by land, sea or air. They are a branch of Army Special Operations Command and U.S. Special Operations Command.

The Ranger School, which began during the Korean War as the Ranger Training Command, is challenging for all. Most who enter the course fail. Between 2010-2014, 58 percent of candidates dropped out — most of those within the first four days, a phase that includes tests of physical stamina, a land navigation course and a 12-mile foot march, according to the Ranger training website.

Rangers have been been part of the military force since the Revolutionary War. These highly qualified soldiers had prominent roles in the War of 1812 and the Civil War. In the June 6, 1944, D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy, Rangers famously scaled the sheer cliffs of Pointe Du Hoc overlooking Omaha Beach.
