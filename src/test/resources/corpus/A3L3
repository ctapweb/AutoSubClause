GROVETOWN, Ga. — C.J. Pearson is in his grandparents’ kitchen when he produces his latest video attack against Barack Obama. The Georgia teenager stares intently at a webcam. He asks whether the president is “ignorant” and really knows what he's doing.

C.J. stands for Coreco JaQuan. His post could easily be ignored since it comes from a 13-year-old. However, his sharp words and in-your-face videos have made him known among Republicans as a young black spokesman for a political party desperate to attract African-American and Hispanic voters.

The recording attracted more than 2 million views on YouTube in two weeks.

As the head of Teens for Ted, he is part of Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. Cruz, who is from Texas, hopes to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee. Whoever wins the Republican nomination would run against a Democrat, the political party of President Barack Obama, in the 2016 presidential election.

Young Firecracker In Media Spotlight

C.J.'s fame has led campaign officials and candidates to seek his support. At the same time, he has come under fire for embarrassing falsehoods on social media. Another problem is that his grandparents don’t agree with his political views and would rather he focus on school.

C.J.’s grandparents have raised him since he was a baby. They say that getting him to keep his mind on schoolwork is not easy.

“What counts most is his education, and if he focuses most of his time on politics, he’s going to fall short,” said his grandmother, Robin Pearson. “We have to bring him back down to Earth to remind him we’re the adults and he’s the child.”

Is A TV Appearance An Excused Absence?

C.J.'s email inbox is filled with requests from TV producers and radio hosts to be on their shows. The latest was an invitation from the television talk show The View. Classmates at his middle school call him Mr. President. Also social media has been hard to resist, and C.J. has thousands of followers on social media like Twitter.

Even when his grandparents discipline him when he misbehaves by taking away his devices, C.J. finds ways to get around the ban. He did a radio interview during his Internet timeout.

C.J. has been interested in politics since second grade when his school held a mock presidential election.

A Viral Video That Launched His Young Career

He was 12 when he first became famous. He claimed that he was dropped from Facebook for a video criticizing Obama. Facebook noted that it closed his account because users must be 13. The video still went viral, and soon many conservative newspapers, and radio and television stations declared him a star. Many Republicans are conservatives and believe in traditional attitudes and values.

As attention grew, C.J. ran into trouble of his own making. He created a fake Twitter account under another name and used it to call himself a racial insult.

Not long ago, C.J. posted one of his most attention-grabbing posts yet. It was a screenshot claiming to be Obama’s Twitter account blocking C.J.'s own account. His post quickly attracted tens of thousands of new followers and a tremendous amount of media coverage.

Except it wasn’t true. A White House spokesman denied C.J.'s claim. “Nobody is or has ever been blocked from the @POTUS Twitter account.” It turned out to be a fake, although C.J. wouldn’t go into details about how it happened.

He calls it a teachable moment for a kid who became too interested in social media fame.

Learning Lessons On The Public Stage

“It’s hard. Being under the spotlight at 13 is hard. I’ve made mistakes. Most 13-year-olds make mistakes and they’re addressed at home. I make mistakes and they’re addressed by The Washington Post” newspaper, he said. “I’ve made mistakes that I hope others don’t, but you learn from them and you move on.”

C.J. next plans to run for chairman of the Georgia Teen Republicans. The group tries to get people to vote for Republican candidates. He has a plan for the next 30 years.

“School board at 18. State Legislature at 21. Run for Congress at 25. I’m tossing around the idea to run for governor or senator after that, and I’ll be older than 35 in 2040. It will be time to run for president.” The state Legislature makes laws for a state.

His grandmother just shook her head and said, “I’m just listening. He’s planned it out."
