SANTIAGO, Chile — A straw hut is tucked between tall buildings in Santiago, Chile's capital.

Sick patients line up to see the woman inside. She belongs to the Mapuche, Chile's largest native group. The Mapuche lived in the area for more than a thousand years before Europeans invaded.

The woman mixes cures out of herbs. She is part of a program run by the government. It aims to use the Mapuche knowledge in health care.

For many years, Chileans looked down on the Mapuche way of life. Now, people are becoming interested in it.

"I'm not Mapuche but I believe in their culture," said Elba Soto. She often comes to the ruka, which is the name for a Mapuche straw home. She is looking for herbs and medicines to ease the pain in her bones. "And I love all of it."

TV Show On The Culture Is Popular

Mapuche designs decorate clothes from New York to Paris. Fancy restaurants cook food with Mapuche ingredients. Ana Tijoux is a popular singer in Chile. She waves the Mapuche flag during her concerts and sings about the people's struggle. Television stations show programs about the Mapuche.

The Mapuche are cool, said Pedro Cayuqueo, a Mapuche who hosts "KulMapu." The popular TV show is about the Mapuche.

Mapuche means "people of the land" in their language. They fought off invaders for hundreds of years. First they stood up against the mighty Incan empire from Peru. Then they fought against the Spanish 500 years ago.

The Spanish gave the Mapuche the southern half of Chile.

Then in the late 1800s, new settlers arrived from Europe. They took over Mapuche lands and pushed them out.

Many Mapuche Are Poor, Less Educated

Today, there are more than 1 million Mapuche. They live in the area around Santiago, Chile's capital. They also live in their traditional homeland in Araucania, near the middle of Chile. It is the country's poorest region.

The Mapuche are far poorer and less educated than other Chileans. They struggle to get enough food and are often sicker than most Chileans. Some are treated unfairly.

Now the Mapuche are demanding their land back. The situation has made people pay attention to the Mapuche.

Young Mapuche now want to explore their way of life. Many Mapuche used to deny belonging to the group, but no longer.

At the hut in Santiago, Natalia Ojeda Hueitra mixes herbal cures. She sees improvement in how Mapuches are treated.

Group Is Growing More Powerful

Before, people looked down on the Mapuche. "Many saw the Mapuche as the lowest of the low," said Hueitra. She wears the traditional "trapelacucha," a large silver collar that spreads to the chest. "Not anymore. Today, it's about empowerment."

Borago is one of the best restaurants in the world. Borago uses traditional Mapuche cooking. The restaurant also cooks with the maqui, a berry that comes from a tree that is sacred to the Mapuche.

VOZ is a fashion company in New York. It works with Mapuche weavers in Chile and sells their hand-woven designs as far away as Asia and the Middle East.

The Mapuche work "is so beautiful and so expertly crafted," said Jasmine Aarons. She runs VOZ. Aarons said the Mapuche weavers tell stories in their artwork. Their stories are "so powerful, like their culture."

Mapuche leader Hugo Alcaman said now the Mapuche are proud of the attention.

"What's happening shows that Mapuche people have a lot of wisdom to share," Alcaman said.
