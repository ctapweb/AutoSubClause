BALTIMORE, Md. — In April, a man named Freddie Gray died. He was injured while being arrested by the police. He died because of this injury.

Many people from Baltimore were upset that this happened. They blamed the police for Gray's death. They protested his death on the streets. Before long these protests became riots, where people and property got hurt.

Twenty-six-year-old Devin Allen took pictures of the protests.

He uploaded dozens of his photos to Instagram and Twitter. Thousands of people saw the photos as the protests happened.

Then Time magazine put one on the cover.

Photographer Wanted To Show Everything

The cover photo is a shot of a single blurred figure running from a wall of police.

Some journalists just paid attention to the bad parts of the protests. Allen was there when it all started and wanted to show the peaceful parts too.

At first he took pictures of peaceful protests. Then, he says, things got more dangerous after some fans leaving a baseball game started yelling hateful things at the protesters.

The people of Baltimore were not just angry about Freddie Gray. Allen says things have been bad for a long time between police and black people in the inner city.

Capturing What Others Missed

Many people just took pictures of the looting or the smashed police cars. Not Allen.

Allen captured what others missed. He stuck around after the riots, taking photos of people coming together again. "They (were) doing cookouts on some blocks since a lot of stores were closed," he says. "Kids playing basketball, dancing and singing, the day after Freddie Gray's funeral."

Allen has tried many jobs. He taught himself how to use the camera a few years ago.

"I didn't find myself until I was 23, when I got a camera in my hand," he says.

He now spends his days taking photos and lives with his mom to save money. Still, he says, "I found myself, and I'm happy."

More Work To Be Done At Home

Allen says Baltimore is still dangerous. He wants something better for his daughter and other children.

At the moment he is raising money for camera equipment. He wants to teach neighborhood kids photography and give them something positive to do. "I want to show them they have a voice," he says.

Allen now has nearly 79,000 followers on Instagram and more than 10,000 on Twitter. Before his pictures got popular, Allen thought about moving to New York to be around more artists. Now he realizes there is still work to be done in his home town and other places like it.

A Glimpse Of Why Riots Happen

There are lots of other cities like Baltimore. Allen thinks people outside the inner cities might not understand the problems between people of different races. By capturing it in a photo, he says he can offer them a glimpse into why riots happen.

"My pictures are supposed to keep you aware," he says. "To make you think. To make you feel."
