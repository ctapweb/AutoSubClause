HERSHEY, Pa. — The United States has more than 10 million old cars. Many people love their old cars. They want to keep them running. They call the cars classic or vintage.

People who love old cars are worried. They say not enough young people are learning to fix them. Most of the people who know how to fix the cars are getting old. Many are no longer working. Young people have not been taking their place.

Young Students, Old Cars

Pennsylvania College may be able to help. In 2012, it began teaching young students how to fix old cars.

Eugene Toner is one of those students. He and other students worked on a 1916 Scripps-Booth Model D car.

The 100-year-old Scripps was very hard to fix. It had not been driven since 1959.

The students could not look up ways to fix it. The had to figure it out on their own.

The students did the best they could. They looked at the engine. They replaced old parts. 

After 56 Years, It Runs!

At last they got the old car going. The engine started up for the first time in 56 years.

Once the Scripps was running again the students wanted to show it off. They decided to bring it to The Elegance. The Elegance is one of the country's most important shows for old cars.

On the day of the show Toner had a big problem. He could not start up the Scripps. The engine just clanked and coughed. It would not start whatever he did.

Toner's teacher quickly helped out. He jiggled an engine part for a bit. The Scripps-Booth started up a few minutes later.

Toner was proud and happy. He began riding the car around the show grounds.

A Prizewinner

Seventy-four of the world's finest cars were at the show. Many people came to see them.

The students who fixed the Scripps-Booth stood by it. They were dressed up as if it was 1916. Showgoers took pictures and asked questions.

The Scripps got a prize.

The show's announcer praised the students. It's nice to see people under 100 who like old cars, he joked.
