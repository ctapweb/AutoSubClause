RALEIGH, N.C. — Before the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his well-known "I Have a Dream" speech to hundreds of thousands of people in Washington, D.C., in 1963, he practiced the message in front of a much smaller crowd in North Carolina.

The civil rights activist delivered a 55-minute speech in front of a small audience and reporters at a high school gymnasium on Nov. 27, 1962. He was in the town of Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The remarks were recorded, but until recently, no one knew if the audio tapes existed. That all changed when an English professor named Jason Miller found an aging tape in a town library. Miller played it in public for the first time Aug. 11 at North Carolina State University.

"It is part civil rights address. It is part mass meeting. And it has the spirit of a sermon," Miller said. He had never before heard Dr. King combine all of those genres into one particular moment.

First Speech Helped Fine-Tune "I Have A Dream"

During this speech, King used the phrase "I have a dream" eight times. He was addressing about 2,000 people at Booker T. Washington High School in Rocky Mount. He delivered the remarks eight months before captivating the nation with the same words at the March on Washington. Historians believe he was fine-tuning elements of the speech before taking it with him to the nation's capital.

King made some changes between the speech at Rocky Mount and the one he delivered in Washington. For example, he referred to "the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners," saying he dreamed they would "meet at the table of brotherhood." But on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, King changed that phrase to "sit down together at the table of brotherhood."

Miller discovered the tape recording while researching for a book he was writing. The book was about the similarities between King's speeches and the poetry of Langston Hughes, an African-American author. He read a newspaper article about the speech in the states' archives. After reading the article, he realized there was likely a recording somewhere as well.

Tape Mysteriously Appeared

Miller's journey to track down the recording of King's earlier speech wasn't easy. He sent many emails and made a lot of calls to other historians as he tried to find it. He eventually heard back in the fall of 2013 from the Braswell Public Library in Rocky Mount. The staff there said a box with the tape recording had mysteriously appeared on a desk one day. Handwriting on the box described it as a recording of King's speech. There was a note that said "please do not erase."

Miller learned something important about King's speeches through his research. He listened to the Rocky Mount recording and read the notes King used for his Washington remarks. He realized that the famous "I have a dream" section was not in the typewritten script King read from in Washington, D.C. Miller and other historians think King improvised the dream phrases in Washington. Some people believe a famous singer in the crowd named Mahalia Jackson shouted "Tell them about the dream, Martin!" in Washington.

Listeners Were Attentive

Three people who were in the audience in Rocky Mount in 1962 listened again as the recording Miller found was played to the public. Herbert Tillman, who was about 17 years old at the time, remembered how happy the crowd was to see and hear such an inspiring leader.

"Everybody was attentive to what he had to say," Tillman said. "And the words that he brought to Rocky Mount were words of encouragement that we really needed in Rocky Mount at that time."

The recording of King's practice speech is now available for the public to listen to. It encourages black people to focus on voting rights and peacefully but forcefully push for change. It is just as inspiring today as it was in 1962.
