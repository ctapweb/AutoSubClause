CLEVELAND, Ohio — The leading Republican presidential candidates had their first face-to-face encounter last Thursday. They used the occasion to try to gain a foothold in the crowded race and attempted to reverse the surprising dominance of celebrity candidate Donald Trump, who now tops polls. The candidates accused Trump — and one another — of diverging from conservative principles.

Trump made news Thursday before even uttering a single word. When the candidates were asked if they would pledge to support whoever ultimately wins the party’s nomination for president, as well as rule out an independent bid, Trump raised his hand to indicate he would not.



The Trump Card?

“I want to win as the Republican — I want to run as the Republican nominee,” he said. When pressed, however, he repeated: “I will not make the pledge at this time.”

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who had promised to get tough during the debate, was quick to attack Trump. Paul said Trump was “already hedging his bets because he’s used to buying politicians.”

Trump’s surprise ascent has complicated an already unruly Republican field. Debate officials separated the 17 candidates into two groups to provide some order to the lineup at Quicken Loans Arena.

The top 10 candidates, ranked based on national polls, took the prime-time stage — with Trump at the center — before a crowd of 5,000. Seven others tangled earlier on the same stage.

The Anti-Obama Field

For most Americans who have not immersed themselves in the details of an election still more than 15 months away, it was the best look yet at the Republicans contenders.

Mostly the candidates shared common promises to unravel many of President Barack Obama’s key accomplishments and push the country rightward. They vowed to stop the nuclear agreement with Iran, reverse Obama’s immigration actions and be tougher on terrorism.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who had been seen as the party’s most likely nominee earlier in the campaign, sought to regain his footing. Bush began slipping in the polls after comments on immigration, women’s health and the Iraq war made him a target for both the left and right.

“I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively,” he said. “We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles” in the right way and the citizens of Florida "rose up" to take advantage of new opportunities.

Bush Jumps On Trump

He also carefully addressed the questions of Trump’s ascent in the polls.

“Mr. Trump’s language is divisive,” and not good for Republicans, Bush said. “We’re going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message.”

Trump, though, made no apologies and doubled-down with an attitude that has become increasingly familiar on the campaign trail.

“We don’t have time for tone — we have to go out and get the job done,” Trump said.

With such a crowded field, the candidates tried to make the most of their few minutes in the spotlight. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker chose to ignore Trump completely and focused instead on their own messages.

Other Solutions

“If this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton’s going to be the next president because she’s been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight,” Rubio said. “This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.”

Ohio Governor John Kasich, who barely qualified for the main debate as the candidate in 10th place in national polling, said Trump had hit a nerve among Americans. People “who want to just tune him out, they’re making a mistake,” he said.

“Now, he’s got his solutions — some of us have other solutions,” he said, before discussing his record as a governor and congressman.

Because Republican primary voters tend to be older and more conservative, the candidates did not shy from polarizing positions, particularly on social issues. There were pledges to defund women's reproductive health-providers Planned Parenthood and to not give the Supreme Court the last word on gay marriage.

The Other Seven Candidates

During the earlier debate featuring the seven lower-polling candidates, former Texas Governor Rick Perry promised to undo many of Obama's actions. Perry humorously promised to bring "a bottle of Wite-Out” to his White House.

The only woman on either stage was Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard chief executive who in 2010 mounted a losing bid to become a California senator. Fiorina, who appeared in the earlier debate, outshone her rivals with crisp attacks on Bush and Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.

“We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring,” Fiorina said.

Trump had tamped down expectations before his debut, saying he did not have as much experience debating as others. Still, his presence dominated the night, even when he was not on the stage.

Women Insulted? "It's Kidding"

In the prime-time debate, Trump sparred with moderator Megyn Kelly of Fox News.

Kelly asked Trump whether insulting comments he had made about women in the past made him unelectable, particularly if he was pitted in the general election against Clinton.

“I frankly don’t have time for total political correctness,” he said. “It’s fun, it’s kidding, we have a good time ... If you don’t like it, I’m sorry.”

Paul and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie engaged in perhaps the night’s most bitter exchange. The two argued over whether Americans’ civil liberties were violated by government phone-call and email monitoring, as the Kentucky senator believes.

When Paul said he wanted to collect records from terrorists, not innocent Americans, Christie called it a “ridiculous answer" and accused Paul of “just blowing hot air” on the issue for political convenience.
