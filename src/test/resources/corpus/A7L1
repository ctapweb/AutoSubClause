LAKE VILLAGE, Ark. — Joe Mencer is a farmer in Arkansas. He grows rice.

Right now, Joe sells rice in the United States. He wants to sell it in Cuba, too. Cuba is a small island country. It is in the Caribbean Sea. People in Cuba speak Spanish.

Joe knows selling rice in Cuba would help him. The country has a lot of people. They eat a lot of rice. It is small, though. There are not enough farms. They must buy rice from somewhere else.

Rice Travels Far From Asia

Right now, Cuba buys rice from Asia. It is very far away. It takes six weeks for the rice to get to Cuba.

Joe could send his rice over in one week.

Still, Joe cannot sell his rice in Cuba. He is not allowed to because of an old law.

In the 1950s, Cuba got a new government. The Cuban government and the United States government did not get along. The president of the United States was John F. Kennedy. He and Congress decided to punish Cuba. The United States would stop doing business with the country.

President Wants To Allow Trade

Now, President Barack Obama wants to make a change. He wants to allow trade with Cuba. This way, American farmers and businesses can sell to Cuba. They can make money doing this.

This might not happen, though. Lawmakers must pass a new law. Many of them disagree. Some lawmakers still do not like Cuba’s government. It could take a long time before rice from Arkansas goes to Cuba.
