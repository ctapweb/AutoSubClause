In 2006, Michael Cox, a chicken farmer in northwest Arkansas, faced a choice that many farmers do: Expand the business or die. His family had been raising chickens for three generations, first for agriculture company Cargill and then for themselves. Even with 800,000 hens laying eggs, Cox was not big enough to compete. "We were planning our funeral," he said.

Cox, who was 25 at the time, switched some of the family's production to organic, which allowed them to charge more money. Then, in 2009, he heard about a Texas startup business called Vital Farms that wanted to produce pasture-raised eggs from chickens that are allowed to wander widely and eat whatever they find. The goal was to sell them across the country. "Here were guys doing something completely different," Cox remembers. "It was just crazy enough to work." So he signed on to raise 5,000 chickens for Vital Farms.

"An Egg Is Not Just An Egg"

Since then, Vital Farms has nearly doubled in size each year. What started as a farm outside Austin with just a few thousand birds now works with about 60 farms and produces 1.5 million eggs every week. The eggs, which cost from $4.99 to $8.99 a dozen, are sold across the country in Whole Foods Markets and other natural-foods grocers, as well as in some mainstream grocery stores, including Safeway and Kroger.

Vital Farms' national distribution lets consumers who live in cold climates such as the Northeast have access to pasture-raised eggs year-round. (Chickens can't graze on pasture if there's no grass.) Moreover, it is proof that companies do not have to compromise on animal welfare, or on how much they pay farmers, to compete in the marketplace. "We set out to build a big business without compromise," Jason Jones, Vital Farms' president, said. Founder and Chief Executive Matt O'Hayer added: "Our job is to show people that an egg is not just an egg."

Free To Roam

A new California law requires that all eggs sold in the state come from hens with enough room to extend their limbs and turn around freely. It has raised consumer awareness, but buyers remain confused about egg labels. According to a survey commissioned by Vital Farms, fewer than half of consumers are familiar with the term "pasture-raised," and the majority thought that "cage-free" and "free-range" mean the birds have been raised outdoors.

In fact, none of those labels has an official definition and they mean different things. Cage-free hens are housed in an average of 1 square foot of indoor space and never go outdoors, while free-range hens get an average of 2 square feet of outdoor space. A Vital Farms laying hen spends most of her day outdoors and is allotted 108 square feet of outdoor space, a standard that translates to 10 acres for 4,000 birds.

A Side Of Grass Clippings

O'Hayer, who delivered eggs as a middle schooler, says it wasn't until he raised backyard chickens in the 1980s that he saw firsthand how a hen's diet affected the quality of her eggs: If the birds ate only corn, which makes up the majority of commercial feed, the yolks were pale and bland. If he threw some grass clippings over the fence, the yolks turned gold and had a deeper flavor.

If the company's standards seemed wildly optimistic when it launched in 2007, Vital Farms had an important backer: Whole Foods. From the beginning, the chain's flagship store in Austin carried its eggs.

Today, Vital Farms works with nearly 40 farms in Missouri and Arkansas. It also has clusters of farmers in Georgia and is building supply in Texas. Recently, O'Hayer met with 28 farmers in Detroit, Texas, and nearly three-quarters of them signed up to explore working with Vital Farms.

Organic Doesn't Come Cheap

Of course, raising hens the Vital Farms way makes for a pricey egg. Their pasture-raised organic eggs can cost as much as $8.99 a dozen compared with $4.69 for standard organic eggs. The "organic" label means that any supplemental feed is certified organic. Even its conventional eggs, called Al Fresco, go for more than twice as much as eggs from caged hens.

To that end, Vital Farms works hard to get out its message. Some of its packaging is designed by David Byrd, a fan of the company who is famous for creating psychedelic posters for rock 'n' roll legend Jimi Hendrix. Each dozen eggs includes a mini-newspaper, the Vital Times, with the motto: The Most Egg-Cellent News on the Planet! The paper explains, for example, what the hens are fed or how drought affects the color of the yolks.

The pitch is working. A spokesman for Whole Foods said pasture-raised options have boosted egg sales overall without taking away from organic sales, and Kroger plans to offer Vital Farms eggs in nearly all of its stores by the end of the year.

The Eggs-Coffee Parallel

The Vital Farms brand inspires loyalty normally reserved for companies like Apple or Nike. Maurice Sinnett of Whidbey Island, Washington, used to buy Vital Farms eggs at a nearby Safeway. When it closed, he went looking at Albertsons. But they didn't have them. So Sinnett started shopping at a local chain grocery store. "It may seem crazy to change stores just for the eggs, but we think they are just that good," he said.

Sinnett likes the richer yolk. But mostly, he is motivated by the company's respect for animal welfare. "There's a humane way to do things and the 'I-don't-give-a-damn-I'm-at-the-top-of-the-food-chain way," he said, adding: "A woman recently asked me how could I pay $6 a dozen for eggs. My answer was, 'How much do you pay for a cup of coffee at Starbucks?'"
