Malala Yousafzai is a Nobel Peace Prize winner. She is the youngest person ever to win the prize. She is just 17 years old.

The prize goes to people who make the world better. Its winners are fighters for peace. They make the world a more fair place.

On June 26, Malala came to San Jose State University. The school is in California.

Four thousand people came to hear Malala. Many held her book, “I Am Malala.”

Malala grew up in Pakistan. Her part of the country was run by the Taliban. The Taliban are very old-fashioned. They believe girls should not go to school.

Rules Kept Her Out Of School

Malala started fighting back when she was only 11 years old. She began writing online. She used the fake name “Gul Makai.”

Malala's writings were read by many people. She wrote about being kept out of school.

Then people found out that she was “Gul Makai.”

The Taliban tried to stop Malala. In 2012, a man shot her in the head.

Malala was very lucky. She was not killed. She is now completely well.

Malala kept on fighting for girls' right to go to school.

Malala came to San Jose State University to talk about her mission. She talked with a famous writer named Khaled Hosseini.

She Decided To Fight Back

Hosseini said the Taliban picked the wrong girl to fight with. Malala will not give up.

Malala explained why some people do not want girls to go to school. These people are afraid. They do not want girls to become smart. If girls learn too much, they will try to change the rules. The Taliban wants girls to stay in their place.

Malala said boys are treated better than girls in Pakistan. It is even true at the dinner table. “Boys would get the chest piece and the leg piece of the chicken," she said. "Girls would get the wings and the neck.”

Hosseini asked Malala why she decided to fight back.

If you do not fight, nothing gets better, Malala said.

Life is hard when you fight back, she said. Still, she thinks it is better than doing nothing.
