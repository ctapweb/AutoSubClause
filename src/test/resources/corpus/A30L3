Basketball player Vaughn Gray says his game has improved. Over the past two seasons, the former forward at George Mason University (GMU) in Virginia noticed some big changes. He found he was able to "see the game slower" and "react to things more efficiently" during play.

"I felt like I was maximizing my motions," Gray said recently. In addition, his "playmaking abilities were more heightened through the breathing techniques."

Breathe, Baby, Breathe

Where had he learned those breathing methods? He and his teammates took several classes in 2013 as part of a GMU study on the possible benefits of a "mindfulness-based intervention." Mindfulness is defined in the study as "bringing conscious attention to the present moment in a receptive curious manner."

The study was published last year. It suggests that approaches based around learning mindfulness may be more effective for athletes than sports psychology, the standard way of dealing with the mental and emotional issues that can affect sports performance. Psychology is the study of how thoughts and feelings affect behavior.

Add Yoga To The Mindful Mix

Mindfulness programs have been around for a while. The new study added another element, however: yoga.

"We wanted to add yoga because athletes are accustomed to physical exercise," said Fallon Goodman, the researcher who oversaw the study. She and the others felt yoga would be a nice addition to the "mindfulness intervention." Traditionally, a mindfulness intervention session "is basically talking for 90 minutes," she said.

Goodman and the others selected a team and administered the mindfulness program to them. They then compared the results to those of a "control group" of club athletes from the school. Control groups are typically used in scientific experiments to compare with the group involved in the study. Both the team and control group answered a long list of questions at the start of a five-week period, and again at the end of it. However, the control group was left to go about its normal business during the five weeks, while the Patriots basketball team underwent eight 90-minute mindfulness intervention sessions.

Those sessions were each followed by an hour of Hatha yoga. Hatha is a gentle form of yoga that emphasizes getting into certain postures and focusing on breathing.

Gain More Focus On Goals

At the end of the five weeks, the team reported feeling more relaxed. Compared with the control group, the basketball players reported greater mindfulness, which was to be expected. However, they also experienced "greater goal-directed energy." The study says this is about pursuing values, both on and off the court, that were in line with what kind of players and people the athletes wanted to be. The players said they found themselves no longer as swayed by peer pressure.

At this point, one thing remains unclear: How much of what the players gained was thanks to the yoga lessons that were added to the mindfulness program? Goodman hopes to settle that question later on through another study.

Certainly, Gray found benefits in both classes he took. "It was good to add the yoga side" to the "mental training," he said. Gray recently graduated and hopes to play professionally overseas. Meanwhile, he still does yoga "every once in a while . . . because I like the way it loosens my body up." He prefers to do it in the morning: "It wakes you up mentally, and it kind of focuses you in, gets you kind of centered in your body and your mind."

Following the classes, the Patriots made the move into a much tougher basketball league, the Atlantic 10. As a result, they faced a difficult couple of seasons. However, Gray said, "There was never any negativity in the locker room. We were able to push through adversity. Even though things may have been rough at the time, when we were losing or whatever, we tried to always stay as a family, because we kind of knew all of each other's personal issues" from the mindfulness interventions.

Mindfulness Versus Sports Psychology

According to Goodman, mindfulness programs have certain benefits not found in standard sports psychology. Sports psychologists encourage athletes to try to control or push away unpleasant thoughts and feelings, she said. By contrast, the mindfulness method teaches athletes to better understand those disturbing thoughts and feelings.

Through mindfulness, people are able to come to terms with the tensions in their life, Goodman said. Instead of pushing away bad thoughts and feelings, or perhaps engaging in bad behaviors to run away from them, they learn to accept and understand those feelings. With greater understanding, "the hope is that your behaviors will then be more in line with things you care about."

Goodman was confident that the yoga sessions had helped with that process. Mindfulness is "hard to explain to someone and to talk about," she said. "Then you're actually kind of living it, or acting it out with your body, with yoga — and then, the next step is, translate that into your sport."

In the future, a greater number of Patriots may know what it is like to be mindful in their sports. Goodman said that, following her study, "a lot of other teams are interested, so I guess that's a sign that something went well."
