About one year ago, on August 9, 2014, a white police officer killed a black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.

The town's black residents were tired of poverty and of being treated unfairly by police. They finally hit their breaking point as the teen, Michael Brown, lay in the street. That day they started protesting in the streets.

Brown's death was only the first chapter of the story. It is not over yet.

A year later, Brown’s death and the protests in Ferguson have changed hundreds of lives. The events also began a national discussion on how police treat black people. Today, Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, is not the same town.

Changes In City Have Not Brought Justice

“Things have changed, a lot,” said David Whitt, who lives near where Brown was killed. Still, somebody was killed by police, "and people say, 'We haven’t got justice,'” he said.

The shooting angered young people who are fighting for equal treatment of blacks.

A U.S. Justice Department report found that Ferguson police stopped cars driven by black people just because of their race. Police also raised money for the city by ticketing and jailing poor residents. The report has led to changes throughout Missouri and deeper discussion of the issues.

“We are making progress,” said Jerryl Christmas. He is a lawyer who represents several activists arrested during protests in Ferguson. “A lot of issues have been raised and a lot of conversation is going on, but we still need more action.”

Police Departments Learn From Ferguson's Mistakes

Investigations found that Officer Darren Wilson shot Brown during a struggle and did not commit a crime. Still, police departments across the country are trying to avoid becoming another Ferguson. They are making changes so that does not happen.

The country saw what happened in Ferguson and attitudes changed. Surveys showed a big increase in the number of whites who agree that race is still a problem in America.

In Ferguson, the city has tried to go back to normal.

“I think we’re going to come out of this, and eventually we’re going to come out of it even stronger, in my opinion,” said Wesley Bell. He is one of two black people newly elected to the Ferguson City Council.

A year ago, protesters burned down businesses. The ashes have been swept away and the streets are clear. Customers have started to shop in stores again.

Business Is Picking Up, One Year Later

“We’re starting to get back into the swing of things, people starting to come slowly but surely,” says Antonio Henley, a barber and the owner of Prime Time Barber Shop. During the protests, he lost up to half his customers, who were scared of the protesters. “But we survived.”

Whitt said that some in Ferguson would rather forget what happened last August.

Change has also come to the city government. Some people say that it is not enough.

Several city officials quit after a Justice Department report said they sent anti-black emails. Now Ferguson has a new police chief and city manager. It still has the same mayor, who is white, and who does not want to quit.

Before Brown's shooting, Ferguson's city council had only one black member out of six. Now it has three.

New Judge Shows Respect

Thomas Harvey is the head of ArchCity Defenders, a group that works to improve the court system. He says that Ferguson’s new judge, Donald McCullin, is treating people with respect.

Harvey added that the police, though, are not acting differently. “It doesn’t change the fact the people are being pulled over and ticketed for essentially what amounts to being poor and black.”

Ferguson is just one small town surrounded by other small towns. They all have their own police departments and their own courts and have many of the same problems as Ferguson.

“If you ask a person who lives in St. Louis County what’s different, they’ll say nothing,” Harvey said.
