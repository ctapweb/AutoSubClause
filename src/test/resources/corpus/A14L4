Nefertiti, the ancient Egyptian queen, has long been at the center of a fantastic mystery.

For decades, archaeologists have speculated on the location of the celebrated queen's remains. She belonged to the family line of the famous King Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut, and while the other royals are all accounted for, her mummy is still missing.

Queen-Size Secret?

Now, however, an archaeologist named Nicholas Reeves claims he has found her secret tomb in the Valley of the Kings. He says it is hidden just beyond a wall near the resting place of Tut, the boy-pharaoh.

The dramatic theory is based on a study of detailed radar scans of Tutankhamun's tomb. The scans reveal the appearance of walls beneath their layers of paint, and Reeves believes he has found a number of cracks indicating two previously concealed doors.

One of these doors could possibly lead to a storeroom, Reeves said. However, the larger door on the north side of the burial chamber, he suggests, could lead to another room holding the remains of Nefertiti, believed by some to be the mother of Tutankhamun.

"Something Pretty Real"

"I have been testing the evidence ever since, looking for indications that what I thought I was seeing was, in fact, not there," Reeves said. "But the more I looked, the more information I found that I seemed to be looking at something pretty real."

Archaeologists have expressed cautious excitement over Reeves' conclusion, although they have yet to embrace it fully. The theory would take many more tests to confirm, although a radar scan could quickly reveal any hollows.

"If I'm wrong, I'm wrong," Reeves said. "But if I'm right this is potentially the biggest archaeological discovery ever made."

The tomb of Tutankhamun has been a puzzle for archaeologists ever since archaeologist Howard Carter famously discovered it in 1922. It is comprised of four rooms, but it is much smaller than those of other pharaohs. Scientists have also found that it was constructed and decorated in stages.

Priceless Treasures, Unsolved Mysteries

When Carter first found it, Tut's tomb was filled with thousands of priceless treasures. It had remained safe from the tomb robbers who ravaged items found in other chambers because of how well it was hidden.

To find Nefertiti would be a huge win for archaeologists. Her discovery might solve some of the mysteries of King Tut's tomb. The queen, famed for her beauty, served as co-ruler with King Akhenaten, her husband, and may have been a pharaoh after his death. What that means is that the contents of her tomb, if it exists, would be just as fantastic as Tutankhamun's — perhaps even more fantastic.

Tutankhamun is believed to have ruled for only nine years, after taking power as a young boy. His remains show that he was a frail child, with buck teeth and a pronounced overbite. Thanks to rounds of royal inbreeding, he had a club foot and could walk only with a cane.

His reign was overshadowed by much more prominent pharaohs who came before him, including Ramses II, Khufu and his father, Akhenaten. Still, the magnificence of his tomb's treasures made the tomb one of the most celebrated archaeological finds in the world. His gold funeral mask is one of the most famous ancient artifacts ever discovered.

A Pharaoh's Curse?

However, there is another aspect of Egyptian archaeology beyond the treasures that has captured the public's imagination: the tombs reflect the beliefs of an ancient religion, and are drenched in symbolism and striking images of the afterlife.

Egyptian burial customs were essentially elaborate ways to ensure immortality after death. Bodies were preserved through mummification and laid in tombs with their riches and belongings. Their organs were removed and preserved separately in jars, and families were expected to bring food to the tombs after the burial.

There are rumors of a "Pharaoh's Curse," which brings bad luck to those who disturb the tombs. Twelve members of the team that opened Tutankhamun's tomb died within seven years, though Carter himself was not among them. The stories of a curse were enough to prevent the superstitious Italian dictator Benito Mussolini from accepting a mummy as a gift.

There is also the strange story of Englishwoman Dorothy Louise Eady, who worked for Egypt's Department of Egyptian Antiquities. Eady, better known as Omm Sety, openly believed that she had been an ancient Egyptian priestess in a past life.

Ancient Egyptian Dreams

Her beliefs, detailed in a number of biographies, were supposedly awakened in her after falling down stairs at 3 years old. She grew up dreaming about her experiences in ancient Egypt, and eventually moved to Egypt to become close friends with a number of prominent archaeologists. She made a number of archaeological discoveries based on what she said were memories, not research.

At one point, she reportedly said she knew where the tomb of Nefertiti was located, based on a conversation in another life with a pharaoh.

"It's in the Valley of the Kings, and it's quite near to the Tutankhamun tomb," she said, according to a biography. "But it's in a place where nobody would ever think of looking for it."

Thanks to the recent findings, it may just turn out that Eady was right all along.
