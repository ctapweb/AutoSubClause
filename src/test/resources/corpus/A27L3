SURAT, India — Their small hands work with the speed and skill of veteran assembly-line workers. As they construct cardboard box after cardboard box, they pause only to wipe the sweat from their foreheads.

The stacks of boxes tower over the small workers. Many of these workers are not yet teenagers, but they fill the dimly lit textile factories and warehouses in Surat — an industrial city in western India.

India has a law that requires children younger than 14 to be in school full time, but millions of Indian boys and girls still work, human rights groups say. They estimate there are more than 50,000 child workers in Surat alone.

The Indian government has said it wants to end child labor, but new proposed laws on the issue have been criticized. Advocacy groups say the proposed laws could actually push more children into the workforce, endangering their education and putting them at greater risk of exploitation.

Will Law Lead To More Child Workers?

The new rules would allow children younger than 14 to work in a "family business" that is not deemed dangerous. Dangerous professions include heavy industry and making fireworks. Still, the rules allow children to work in almost any other industry — as long as the company is owned by relatives and the children are working after school.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s conservative government said it was trying to strike a balance. One one hand, children need an education. On the other hand, the reality in India is that many poor families need to have their children work.

In many poor Indian families, boys and girls help their parents from an early age. Supporters of the proposal say banning all child labor would hurt small farmers, shopkeepers, cooks and others who depend on having help from their children.

The number of child laborers in India has fallen sharply over the last 10 years, according to government numbers. There were 12.6 million child workers in 2001 and 4.3 million in 2011. Still, these numbers may not count many children who work in family businesses.

People who fight for child rights fear the new proposal could help companies take advantage of children. For instance, employers could hire children by calling them “family.”

In Surat, bosses of textile factories making cloth routinely tell labor inspectors that the boys working there are their relatives.

Trying To Match The Education Law

Government surveys show that many child workers in Surat have migrated from poorer states. Experts say the children don’t dare to contradict their bosses, fearing punishment. Authorities rarely investigate further.

“Family business sounds good. But what we have found is that bosses say, ‘I’m his uncle’ or ‘he’s my son,’ and law enforcement is not very keen to verify the claim,” said Chandrashekhar Deshmukh, who heads a rights group for children in Surat. “If this practice gets legal cover, child labor might actually increase.”

A 2009 law in India requires full-time schooling for all children younger than 14. Now, authorities are trying to change child-labor rules to match the education law.

Earlier labor laws in India banned children under 14 from working only in 18 hazardous industries. The proposals giving exceptions to family-businesses must pass both houses of Parliament and the president. Analysts say they have a good chance of becoming law.

Trade unions, groups that fight for the rights of workers, support the new rules. They point out that international labor rules require countries to set a minimum working age of 14. The rules don't allow children to do work that hurts their health or well-being.

“It’s a very progressive amendment, and it is very clear,” said Vrijesh Upadhyay, a trade union leader. “Suppose I am a shopkeeper. My child comes after school and sits with me, he helps me — that’s allowed. If in any way he earns money, that is child labor and that will be punished.”

Sends The Wrong Signal, Some Say

The proposed rule changes will make punishments for employers who break child-labor laws harsher. They could now face two years in prison and an $800 fine the first time they break the rule. The proposal also loosens the punishments for parents. They will not be punished the first time their child is found breaking a child-labor rule, acknowledging that some children have to work because their family is so poor.

Teachers say it is important for children to study and play outside of school. Regular work that cuts into this time can harm children's development. It can also increase the likelihood that they will drop out of school. Farmwork exposes children to harmful chemicals called pesticides. In Surat’s garment industry, which makes traditional Indian clothing, children work all-day shifts for as little as $1.50.

Critics say the proposed changes send the wrong signal from Modi’s government. The country has been trying to help India get more money from overseas companies through a new project called “Make in India.”

“There is a feeling that if children are blocked from working, the garment industry or other industry might suffer,” said Prabhat Kumar. He works for a charity called Save the Children.

“But if you really look at the issue, this won’t be the case. No one would support the idea of ‘Make in India’ meaning ‘Made by Children,’” he said.
