GROVETOWN, Ga. — C.J. Pearson is in his grandparents’ kitchen. The Georgia teenager is making his latest video attack against Barack Obama. He stares into a webcam. He asks whether the president really knows what he is doing.

C.J. stands for Coreco JaQuan. Many people would just ignore his videos since they come from a 13-year-old. Yet they have made him famous in the Republican Party. C.J. is African-American. The group wants to be more popular with black and Hispanic voters.

His video was seen more than 2 million times on YouTube.

Teen's Fame Led To Role In Candidate's Campaign

C.J. is the leader of Teens for Ted. He is part of Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. Cruz is a lawmaker from Texas and is running for president. C.J. wants Cruz to win the Republican nomination. Whoever wins the nomination will run for president against a Democrat in 2016. President Barack Obama is a Democrat. As the head of Teens for Ted, C.J. wants to get people to vote for Cruz.

TV and radio stations want C.J. to be on their shows. The latest invitation came from the television talk show The View. Classmates at his middle school call him Mr. President. Also C.J. has thousands of followers on social media like Twitter and Facebook.

Many Republican campaign workers and candidates want his help. At the same time, many people have become angry at C.J. for posting things that are not true.

Fame Began With Video Slamming President

When C.J. was 12, he made a video criticizing Obama. Then he claimed he was dropped from Facebook because of it. Facebook said it closed his account because he was too young. Users must be 13. Soon many radio and television stations and newspapers declared him a star. Many of their readers and listeners are Republican.

As attention grew, C.J. ran into trouble of his own making. He created a fake Twitter account under another name and used it to call himself an anti-black name.

Not long ago, C.J. got into trouble again. He posted a picture of what was supposed to be Obama’s Twitter account blocking C.J.'s account. His post quickly got tens of thousands of new followers.

Faking A Message From The White House

It was not true, though. A White House official denied C.J.'s claim. “Nobody is or has ever been blocked from the @POTUS Twitter account.” It turned out to be a fake, although C.J. would not say what happened.

He said he learned a lot from it.

“It’s hard. Being under the spotlight at 13 is hard. I’ve made mistakes. Most 13-year-olds make mistakes and they’re addressed at home. I make mistakes and they’re addressed by The Washington Post” newspaper, he said. “I’ve made mistakes that I hope others don’t, but you learn from them and you move on.”

He has another problem. His grandparents do not agree with his ideas and want him to spend more time on his schoolwork.

“What counts most is his education," said his grandmother, Robin Pearson. "We have to bring him back down to Earth to remind him we’re the adults and he’s the child.”

School Election Sparked Interest In Government

C.J. has been interested in government since second grade. His school held a pretend election for president. Of course, he voted for the Republican candidate.

C.J. has made plans for the next 30 years.

He wants to be a state lawmaker at 21 and a government lawmaker at 25. He is thinking maybe about becoming the governor of a state after that. Then in 2040, it will be time to run for president, he said.
