LONDON — Forgiving debt, if done right, can get an economy back on its feet.

A new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) argues that Greece should get help.

Greece has many creditors, countries that have loaned it money. Germany is one of the biggest creditors to Greece. It is resisting forgiving Greece's debt, even though it knows better than most what debt relief can achieve. After the hell of World War II, Germany got massive help with its debt from former foes.

Among its creditors then? Greece.

Sparking The German Economic Miracle

In 1953, Greece and about 20 other countries wrote off a large chunk of Germany's loans and restructured the rest to make them easier to pay. The case of Germany shows how effective debt relief can be and helped spark what became known as the German economic miracle.

So it might seem a bit odd that Germany is now among the countries resisting Greece's requests for help.

Greece now owes more than $332 billion to other countries, and its economy has fallen, as businesses suffer and people have little money to spend.

Here's a look at when Germany got debt relief, and if such action might help Greece.

The London Agreement of 1953 was generous to West Germany. It cut the amount owed, extended the repayment schedule and charged West Germany low interest rates on the money it owed.

It linked West Germany's debt repayment schedule to its ability to pay. This meant that other countries had a reason to buy German goods, because this allowed Germany to pay its debt.

Because of the deal, other countries could not ask Germany to pay for the destruction the Nazis inflicted during the war.

A Case Of Politics, Not Charity, In 1953

But it wasn't a one-way street.

"The London Agreement gave Germany sweeping debt forgiveness and protection from creditors, in exchange for pro-market reforms," said Professor Albrecht Ritschl of the London School of Economics.

West Germany was able to borrow internationally, and because it had smaller debt payments, its economy grew strong.

Development activists point to that case when arguing for easier terms for troubled countries today.

"The same opportunity should be given to Greece that was given to Germany in 1953," said Eric LeCompte, executive director of debt relief organization Jubilee USA.

The German debt forgiveness was driven by the United States.

It wasn't charity. The U.S needed a strong West Germany as an ally against the perceived threat of the Soviet Union, and the spread of communism, which had taken hold in East Germany.

Yale University Professor Timothy Guinnane warns against making too many comparisons, partly because Germany was so much more important to global politics than Greece is today.

Greece Hit Hard By Depression

And Germany had economic power. It was a major exporter, which means it sold goods it made to other countries. Greece, on the other hand, makes and exports few goods. That's partly why Germany is insisting on reforms to make Greece more competitive economically.

"The U.S. was basically the last man standing after the war and essentially decided to cut Germany's debt in half," Guinnane said. "It was a hard-nosed decision ... it's wrong to say it was an act of generosity."

Still, there are echoes from the German case that are similar to Greece's situation today.

The deal to help Germany was based on a realistic way for the country to pay its debts. Unlike Germany, Greece has had to make debt payments even though its economy was in a depression.

Germany's deal after World War II also admitted that mistakes were made after World War I. Germany was punished economically by the countries that won the war, which led to extremist groups like the Nazis who became popular by pointing out how Germany had been treated. In Greece, extremist parties, including Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn, have been on the rise.

One of the reasons why relations between Greece and European creditors fell apart is the disagreement over what to do about the country's debts. It's difficult for anyone to accept a lower return on the money they loaned.

"A Significant Haircut"

But there are signs of movement. On Sunday, the countries of the European Union will meet to discuss a plan Greece has put forward to fix its economy and pay back part of what it is owed.

The country of Cyprus has said it could consider writing off $370 million in rescue loans to Greece. The U.S., while not directly involved, favors debt relief.

The IMF report argued that Greece needs large-scale debt relief and more than $67 billion in financing between now and the end of 2018. Given the recent economic shock, Greece's needs will likely be significantly higher, the IMF said.

It blamed the current government for being slow on reforms, but said it was clear the debt needed to be made more manageable.

"A significant haircut could possibly do it," an IMF official said. "So could an extension, so Greece would not have to go back to the markets for a very long time."

One option the IMF mentioned was doubling the grace period on Greece's loans from EU countries to 20 years and the repayment period to 40 years.

"Greece needs a sort of breathing space," the IMF official said.
