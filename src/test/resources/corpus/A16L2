CLEVELAND, Ohio — The race to become the next president of the United Sates has gotten very crowded. The election is in 2016. So far, 17 Republicans have announced their candidacy. Everyone running for president is known as a candidate until a winner is declared, or until they drop out of the race.

First the Republican candidates must run against each other to be their party's choice. The winner of that race will run against a Democrat next year in the general election. The person who is picked from the Republican and Democratic group is known as the nominee.



Two Debates For 17 Candidates

Last Thursday, the 17 Republican candidates gathered together for the first time. Because there are so many of them, they were divided into two groups. One group was made up of the 10 most popular candidates. Their popularity was decided based on polls, in which people were asked who they plan to vote for. The other group was made up of the seven less popular candidates.

The candidates came to introduce themselves to America on national TV. Each wanted to show that he or she is the best person to pick. Of course that meant arguing that the others are not right for the job. The seven less popular candidates spoke first. They were then followed by the top 10.

Thursday's gatherings were the first debates of the election. A debate is a sort of contest between speakers, with rules about how long a person can speak. Each candidate tries to make the best points and tries to win over the audience.

Attacking Donald Trump

On Thursday many of the candidates attacked the leading candidate, Donald Trump. A billionaire and TV star, Trump has surprised many people. He is doing much better than expected and is now leading the polls. Still, some people feel he is not ready to be president. Unlike most of the others he has never been a governor or senator.

The other candidates accused Trump of not being a real conservative.

In general, conservatives support old-fashioned values and traditional ways of doing things. The Republican Party has gotten more conservative in recent years. Democrats tend to be more liberal. They are more in favor of change. For example, many Republicans are against allowing gay marriage, while most Democrats support it.

For most Americans, it was their first real look at many of the Republican candidates.

Most of the candidates promised to push the country in a more conservative direction if elected.

Bush Pledges To "Unite People"

Before Trump took off in the polls, Jeb Bush was considered most likely to become the nominee. Bush was once the governor of Florida. His father and his brother were both presidents. He has been slipping in the polls for several months. Partly this is because many Republicans do not consider him conservative enough. On Thursday he tried to fight his way back.

“I governed as a conservative,” he said of his years as Florida's leader. “We left the state better off."

Bush also criticized Trump for nasty remarks Trump has made about Mexicans. Many people feel Trump's remarks are racist and unfair.

Trump's comments divide people and are not good for Republicans, Bush said. “We’re going to win when we unite people.”

Criticized For Insulting Women

Trump did not apologize, however.

Trump also fought with Megyn Kelly, a Fox News reporter. Kelly asked Trump about insulting comments he has made about women in the past.

Trump said people were wrong to take his comments seriously. “It’s fun, it’s kidding, we have a good time," Trump said. "If you don’t like it, I’m sorry.”

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie got into the nastiest fight of the night. The two argued over whether the U.S. government was wrong to secretly record millions of phone calls and email messages. Paul said it was wrong. Christie disagreed and said that Paul was "ridiculous."
