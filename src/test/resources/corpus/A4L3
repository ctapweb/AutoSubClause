WASHINGTON — Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton received a big shock to her campaign. She is the leading candidate in the Democratic presidential primary, but she discovered a new and unexpected weak spot — her campaign fundraising. 

Clinton's campaign announced Wednesday that it had raised more than $28 million from July to October. That amount was nearly matched by the $26 million that Senator Bernie Sanders brought in. Sanders raised that much thanks to small contributions that accumulated at a fast rate.

As the deadline neared for third-quarter donations, Sanders' passionate supporters raced to raise even more money. It is possible that he might even finish the year with more in the bank than Clinton.

Fundraising Frenzy

The senator from Vermont has largely avoided wealthy donors and fancy fundraisers. His success in raising money could change the outcome of the primary election.

Sanders success in raising money gives new boost to his chances of winning. Until now, he has not been seen by many leaders in the Democratic Party as a serious threat to Clinton.

Clinton campaign officials said they were pleased by her summer fundraising total. She raised the money after dozens of expensive fundraising events and an intense push for online donations. Clinton aides noted that they are on track to reach their goal of raising $100 million by the end of the year.

"We are thrilled and grateful for the support of hundreds of thousands of donors across the country," Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said.

But advisers to Sanders are amazed at how close the two campaigns are.

"I think it's remarkable that Bernie Sanders was able to raise almost as much money as Hillary Clinton, particularly given the way he is raising money," said Tad Devine. He is a campaign expert advising Sanders.

Every Dollar Counts

Both campaigns acknowledged the importance of the numbers late Wednesday. One Sanders supporter tweeted: "There's still time." And former President Bill Clinton wrote in an evening email to supporters of his wife's campaign: "Will you help elect her by donating $1 before midnight tonight?"

Shortly after midnight, a Sanders worker said the campaign had raised more than $2 million online just that day. About $500,000 of that came in after 10:30 p.m.

Only one other campaign released totals Wednesday, the last day of the fundraising quarter. Republican candidate Ben Carson pulled in at least $20 million, according to a spokesman.

The competition over fundraising totals comes as Sanders has pulled even or taken the lead in opinion polls from Iowa and New Hampshire. The two states hold their primaries first.

In all, Clinton has raised $75 million. Sanders has pulled in more than $40 million.

Devine said the senator's team thought they would need at least $40 million to compete against Clinton before the voting starts. It hit that mark months ahead of schedule.

Money In The Bank

Sanders's campaign said it still has more than $25 million in the bank. Sanders is running a thrifty campaign. It has not yet begun broadcasting television ads, unlike the Clinton campaign.

Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist who condemns the political influence of the "billionaire class." Sanders would like a European-style socialist government in America that has gives everyone health care and free college. He has focused on raising money over the Internet, mostly in small amounts.

By Wednesday evening, his campaign said it had received 1.3 million donations from about 650,000 different donors.

As of June 30, Clinton had more than 250,000 individual contributors, but her campaign declined to share the current number.

Cash On Hand As Well

Unlike most other presidential candidates, Sanders has discouraged the support of super PACs. Such Political Action Committees are groups that are run independently of the campaigns. Yet they have the ability to raise unlimited amounts of money to promote their candidates.

Clinton has also condemned the influence of big money on politics. However, she is accepting the backing of two super PACs working to help elect her. The main group, Priorities USA Action, raised $15.6 million in the first half of the year and has commitments for another $25 million.

As President Obama demonstrated in his races, a large number of small donors can be a powerful force. In his 2012 re-election campaign, 28 percent of individual contributions came from donors who gave $200 or less, according to research by the group Campaign Finance Institute. That amount was some $216 million.

Devine said the Sanders campaign had made a decision not to try to match Clinton's spending on television ads early in the process. It wanted to have the money when it needs it. "We wanted to have as big a pile of cash on hand," he said.
