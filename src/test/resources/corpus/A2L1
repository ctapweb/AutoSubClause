NEW YORK, N.Y. – Not long ago, I met a young girl. She was in Jordan, a country in the Middle East. She had just left Syria, another country in the Middle East. Syria has a lot of violence. Many families have left the country. I first met her in a tent classroom. Later, I saw her again, playing with other children on a poorly built playground.

Schools Help Dreams Come True

I asked her where she would rather be, learning in the classroom or playing with her friends. I know at her age I would have rather been playing. She said she wanted to be in class. The violence in Syria made her leave her home and friends. She also lost her chance at an education. She needed school if she was ever going to get her dream. She wants to become a doctor.

Many children affected by the fighting in Syria want an education. Children want to go to school.

Schools Are Safe And Healthy

In a place of violence, school is a safe place. It is a place to learn, and get a chance to live a healthy life. It is a place where children can hope for the future. Education makes it more likely that someday children will be able to make money. They can give their families a better life. School also gives them skills. They can use what they learn to help their neighbors. They can help make their communities better.

It helps to give the children affected by emergencies a chance to learn. It also helps their home countries. Leaders around the globe have plans. They want to start focusing on some new goals to help countries to grow. These goals will try to make some good changes in poor countries.

People around the world agree that schools are important. Schools can help create a more equal society. They can decrease fighting.

Children In Danger

As we begin working toward the new goal, there is a problem. There are so many children facing danger around the world. Experts say many children out of school are living in a country having an emergency.

For the youngest children, these emergencies mean they never start school. For others, it means they must stop going to school. They might never go back. There might also not be enough well-trained teachers. Students might not get school supplies.

More Money Needed For Schools

There are more children in danger of not getting to learn than ever before. Still, there is not very much money to help these children. In 2013, out of every $100 in emergency money, only $2 of it went to schooling. Learning is an important part of helping children in an emergency.

We need more money to help these children go to school.

This is a choice we must make together. Should we give these children school? Without school, these children might never see their dreams come true. They will also not be able to help their own countries in the future. We will all have to pay when this happens.
