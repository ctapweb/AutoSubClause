WASHINGTON, D.C. — Some states want to get kids to unplug from computers and plug in to the outdoors at state parks.

States such as Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico and North Carolina are sponsoring activities for students. State governors have hosted campouts for young people and their families as part of a program called Capital Campouts.

The programs have two goals: to encourage youth to be more active at a time when childhood obesity rates are climbing and to build younger Americans’ appreciation for nature and support for parks and conservation.

“Young people need to have a healthy lifestyle and truly experience the nature of the world and not some virtual reality through a gaming device,” said Lewis Ledford. He is executive director of the National Association of State Park Directors. “Smelling the fresh air, understanding the stars at night, knowing about the life cycles of ecology - this is important for the stewardship of future generations and is vital in conserving and protecting our natural resources," he said.

More Park Visitors On A Tighter Budget

Attendance at state parks is up, but their budgets have been hit hard since the recession in 2008. Their costs have gone up, but funding from state legislatures has dropped in the last five years.

Many parks have been forced to cut staff or reduce hours or programs. Some have boosted entrance and camping fees or turned to private donors or money from state lottery sales for help. Some states have hired teens to help with upkeep and improvements.

Across the United States, there are more than 5,000 state parks and recreation areas that include historic sites and wildlife areas. More than 700 million people visit state parks each year, Ledford says, and that number keeps growing. Two-thirds of them bring children. Parks officials say children who grow up in households that don’t visit parks as a family tradition are less likely to visit parks as adults.

“If our future leaders have no relationship to nature, no understanding of how clean air and clean water are produced and what a healthy environment is, they won’t have the knowledge, nor will they care about, doing anything about the stewardship of the Earth,” said Nita Settina of the Maryland Park Service. If parks provide fun adventures, children will become park visitors, she said. Someday, they will bring their own children, she added.

Jobs Programs Pair Teens With Great Outdoors

Maryland, Missouri, Virginia and other states have created job programs for teens to attract them to the parks. Maryland has been running its jobs program for eight years. This summer, about 300 teens got paid to build trails, fix picnic pavilions, clean streams, plant trees and create butterfly gardens. They also spent part of their time canoeing, fishing and camping.

Most teens came from Baltimore or other urban areas and were not familiar with outdoor life. Many had never left their neighborhoods, and it was the first time they had seen the Atlantic Ocean or been camping, said Settina, the park service chief. “It’s one of the most important things we do. It’s also one of the most gratifying.”

Experts give many reasons for why kids are much less likely to play outdoors or be in touch with nature today. Studies show that a big factor is that they’re hooked on technology. Children spend about seven hours a day watching TV, using computers, phones and other electronic devices. That means they are less physically active, which could result in higher rates of obesity.

Inactivity Linked To Higher Obesity In Children

Over the past 30 years, obesity has more than doubled in younger children and more than quadrupled in teens. In 2012, more than one-third of children and teens were overweight or obese. That’s why state parks officials say they must provide programs that encourage youngsters to get outdoors.

In New Mexico, the Parks Department runs an outdoor classroom program. Teachers train at state parks in such areas as testing water quality and identifying insects and birds. The teachers take their students to the parks and turn classroom lessons into hands-on experiences. The program is trying to preserve the heritage of New Mexico by encouraging young people to preserve parks for the future, said Christy Tafoya, the state parks director.

New Mexico teachers and schools can apply for funds to pay for buses to take students to the parks. The money comes from taxpayers who donate a portion of their refunds when they file their taxes.

Campouts Bridge The Gap From TV To Tree Frogs

The governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, welcomed 10 families at Brandywine Creek State Park in Wilmington as part of the Capital Campouts program. The families, most outdoor novices, set up tents and camped overnight. The campers learned about owls, crickets and tree frogs, and they roasted s’mores by the campfire.

“You have a whole generation of kids who grew up on video games. People now are so connected to technology that they don’t put it down and don’t go outside,” said Ray Bivens, director of Delaware State Parks. It is the parks' responsibility to have programs that teach kids outdoor skills, he said. "Being able to identify a couple of stars in the night sky, they just love it.”
