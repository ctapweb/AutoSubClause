SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — Paul Brown sets out before sunrise to patrol Sacramento. He is looking for physical evidence that someone is wasting California’s scarcest resource, water. It may be a moist sidewalk, or a flooded curb gutter, or a suspiciously damp driveway.

Every so often he catches a lawn-care violation in action, such as sprinklers whirring on a city-mandated no-watering day.

Brown can usually walk away unnoticed after writing a warning to an offender. Early risers can complicate his job with the municipal Water Conservation Office, though. One rule-breaker he snared called him a water Nazi, and two weeks ago a woman swore after he issued her a $50 fine. Homeowner Robin Sortman, watching Brown snap photos of his telltale wet pavement, asked why the city gets to decide which two days a week he can irrigate.

“I’m not sure I understand the problem,” he said, showing off his empty swimming pool. “I’m not able to enjoy my summer this year. I shower twice a week. We don’t flush the toilet every time. We use our water very minimally.”

Whole State Under Conservation Order

California’s current drought is the worst the state has experienced in living memory. It has been going on for four years and seems like it will never end. It's really starting to get on people’s nerves. Regulators issued rules last month for cutbacks that Governor Jerry Brown ordered in April, marking the first time all the state’s 39 million inhabitants have been forced to conserve.

Some are better about it than others. This is why there are water cops such as Brown, and hotlines and websites in cities including Los Angeles, Bakersfield and Stockton for residents to snitch on those being wasteful — which, according to city officials, residents are enthusiastically doing.

“We’re in a really deep hole,” said Peter Gleick, co-founder of the nonprofit Pacific Institute in Oakland, a group which focuses on water issues. “There’s this feeling on the part of some, ‘Why are you asking me to do more when my neighbor has done nothing?’”

The 411 water districts that supply nonagriculture customers must cut deliveries from 2013 levels by a range of 4 percent to 36 percent. The severity of the cut depends on historical water consumption in the area. They must do this in order to achieve the statewide 25 percent reduction decreed by Brown. Farms receive their water supply from other providers, who have also had their rations severely cut.

DroughtShame App Reports Water-Wasters

Several steps are being taken to achieve the goal, such as dictating when outdoor taps can be switched on or imposing surcharges on residences or businesses that exceed per-gallon monthly caps. Californians are having a hodgepodge of reactions. One is drought-shaming, which, of course, has a hashtag on Twitter: "#DroughtShame."

People post photos to call out wasters on the DroughtShame app, which can be used to send pictures of water-wasting to authorities. People are taking a keen interest in famous people and owners of mansions in places such as Montecito and Beverly Hills. Oprah Winfrey, Sean Penn and Kim Kardashian and her husband, Kanye West, have taken heat for their lush green yards.

According to June Tangney, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, there isn't clear evidence to confirm that shaming offenders will change their behavior. It does, however, "satisfy the desire for revenge,” she says. “It comes from a desire to punish.”

The app’s inventor, Santa Monica real estate broker Dan Estes, said his motivation was something else entirely. He fears for California’s future.

“You watch the news at night and you see pictures of the lakes that have dried up,” Estes said. “The next morning, you’re walking the dog and you see water all over the sidewalk." The two just don't make sense, he says.

History Of Drought, Water Theft

Drought has been a constant throughout California's history. One drought in the mid-1800s devastated the cattle industry. An extended dry spell in the 1930s created tensions between Lake Tahoe property owners and people downstream in Nevada. Officials in Nevada sent a steam shovel and a Reno police officer to cut a trench through the lake’s rim so more of its water would flow toward them.

In 2015, history is repeating itself. This time, in Madera County, near Fresno, some residents are using irrigation tubing to steal water from neighbors. Water has become very valuable, said Madera County District Attorney David Linn. He recently set up a water-crime task force to investigate such thefts, including from fire hydrants.

Snowpack Lowest Since 1950

This drought is among the most severe in California history. Mountain snowpack, which provides about 30 percent of the state’s water, is the lowest since 1950. Precipitation has been scarce, and 2014 set a high-temperature record.

In Sacramento, California’s capital, consumption is supposed to fall 28 percent through February. Fines for failing to obey the rules start at $50 and go up to $1,000. Violators can avoid paying by attending water school, which consists of a one-hour class on the benefits of low-flow sprinkler heads and drought-friendly landscaping.

State government is doing its part, by not watering at the state government's Capitol building. The untended lawn surrounding the Capitol building has turned brown. A sign stuck in the dirt says, “Californians Don’t Waste.”
