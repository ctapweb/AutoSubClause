Misty Copeland made history on Tuesday when she was promoted to principal dancer of the American Ballet Theatre (ABT). She became the first African-American ballerina to reach the elite dance company's top rank.

Copeland, 32, has become one of America's most famous female athletes. She is deeply respected and admired for her unlikely rise in an arts world notorious for showcasing only slim white ballerinas.

A Star Athlete On Pointe And Off

Her star power has stretched far beyond dance, yielding larger and larger business opportunities offstage as her importance onstage has grown. She has written a best-selling book about her life. This year, she was featured on the cover of Time magazine's "100 Most Influential People" issue. And she has starred in an Under Armour ad that went viral on the Internet. The ad shows her twirling while a woman's voice reads a rejection letter declaring that she has "the wrong body for ballet."

"Bringing on Misty Copeland is the best decision we've ever made," said Adrienne Lofton. She is senior vice president of global brand marketing for Under Armour, the Baltimore-based sportswear giant.

"We've always had powerful female athletes, but we've never had a story as dynamic as Misty's, with that underdog mentality she has ... bucking up against all these traditional norms, showing men, women and kids that athletes come in all shapes and sizes."

A Breakthrough As The White Swan

Copeland, whose new position starts August 1, was widely expected to be among the three women selected as principals this year. She has performed many starring roles recently, including the female leads in "Romeo and Juliet" and "Firebird," but at the lower rank of soloist.

Earlier this spring, Copeland made her American debut in the lead role of Odette/Odile in "Swan Lake" at the Kennedy Center in Washington. It was a symbolically significant moment in American culture. Copeland became the first black woman to dance the role of ballet's famed white swan. All of her performances sold out from the moment tickets went on sale months earlier.

"I haven't come from the typical path or background of someone who would make it to this level as a ballerina," she told a newspaper at the time. "When it came to my childhood — growing up in a single-parent home, often struggling financially — my mother definitely instilled in me and my siblings this strength, this will, to just continue to survive and succeed."

From Poverty To Pop Icon

Copeland took her first dance class on a basketball court at a Boys and Girls Club in San Pedro, California, at age 13. She started ballet years after most young ballerinas begin their training. She was inspired by a television movie about Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci.

She is curvier and more muscular than most ballerinas. She was raised by a single mother on welfare. Despite these challenges, Copeland rose to become the American Ballet Theatre's second-ever black soloist, at age 24.

Copeland's popularity and name recognition quickly grew beyond the world of ballet lovers. She has starred in Dr Pepper and BlackBerry ads. She has also performed in concert with Prince and judged contestants on Fox television's "So You Think You Can Dance."

The film rights for her best-selling memoir, "Life in Motion," were bought last summer. Copeland has also written an illustrated children's book, "Firebird," named for one of her first big roles with the American Ballet Theatre.

Turning Women Onto Under Armour

Perhaps her biggest star turn, however, has come through her sponsorship deal with Under Armour. Copeland became the face of its worldwide "I Will What I Want" ad campaign. Other elite athletes involved in the campaign include Olympic soccer star Kelley O'Hara and pro surfer Brianna Cope.

The retailer now calls that ad campaign its most successful in history. Lofton said that underdog stories like Copeland's help "break through the clutter" and turn a new wave of women onto the sportswear brand.

The Under Armour ad that captures her efforts to break through the barriers of classical ballet has been viewed more than 8 million times on YouTube. She also has become a sensation on social media. She has more than 500,000 followers on Instagram and Twitter with pictures of her performing or relaxing in Under Armour tops and tights.

Despite her star power on stage, Copeland told the sports network ESPN last year that the Under Armour deal pays her more than professional ballet. Her company's soloists typically made between $50,000 and $100,000 a year.

Copeland has helped Under Armour, which got its start with men's football gear, capture a growing, yet underserved market. Women's sports apparel made up $600 million of Under Armour's $3 billion in revenue last year.

"We believe our women's business can be as large if not bigger than our men's business, and we'll stick to that," said Kevin Plank, chief executive officer of Under Armour.

Women represent more than 60 percent of the 130 million users of Under Armour's Connected Fitness app. Women have been crucial to the online fitness business that the retailer is spending wildly to win.

"Tears Of Joy" For A Role Model

After American Ballet Theatre announced Copeland's promotion to principal dancer, social media went wild. Congratulations poured in for her from companies, the ballet community and fans. Among them was television personality Star Jones. She wrote "crying tears of joy for @mistyonpointe and all the little girls she will inspire," referring to Copeland by her Twitter handle.

And yet, as Copeland said, her accomplishments are still as important personally as they are publicly.

"Every time I step onto the stage, it's not only proving to the audience that I'm capable, but to myself."
